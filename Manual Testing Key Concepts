Module 1.1
ERROR (Due to Human mistake)
    ↓
DEFECT/BUG (Usually In code)
    ↓
FAILURE (A System crash or wrong output from an Application)

Real World Example:
ERROR: Developer types "if (age > 18)" instead of "if (age >= 18)" while coding an application
DEFECT: Code contains wrong logic
FAILURE: 18-year-old users can't register in the Application(Could result to Revenue losses, etc)

VERIFICATION: "Are we building the product right?"
- Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs
- Checks process compliance
- Example: Code review to check coding standards

VALIDATION: "Are we building the right product?"
- Actual testing against business requirements
- End-user perspective
- Example: Testing to ensure the "login" feature works as Users expect

QA vs QC(Diff)
QA (Process-oriented):
- Proactive
- Preventing defects
- Process improvement
- Example: Creating test standards, code review checklists

QC (Product-oriented):
- Reactive
- Finding defects
- Testing actual product
- Example: Executing test cases, reporting bugs

Module 1.2: Software Development Life Cycle (60 min)
Key SDLC Models
1. Waterfall Model

Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
     ↓           ↓           ↓            ↓          ↓
   (Sequential - each phase completes before next begins)
Usage: Regulated industries e.g Healthcare, Government etc
QA Entry Point: After development completes
Pros: Clear documentation, structured
Cons: Late bug discovery, inflexible to changes

2. Agile/Scrum Model 
Sprint Planning → Development + Testing → Review → Retrospective
        ↓                                    ↑
        └─────────────── (Repeat) ──────────┘
        
Sprints last = 2-4 weeks of work (Total Project SDLC timeline broken down into Sprints)
Real-World Agile Sprint Example:
Day 1-2: Sprint Planning
- User story: "As a user, I want to login with email and password"
- Acceptance criteria defined
- QA reviews requirements, asks questions

Day 3-8: Development + Testing (Parallel)
- Developer codes login feature
- QA writes test cases
- QA tests each completed component
- Daily standup: "I'm testing login API, found 2 bugs"

Day 9: Sprint Review
- Demo to stakeholders
- QA presents test results: 45 test cases, 5 bugs found, 4 fixed

Day 10: Retrospective
- What went well: Early QA involvement caught design issues
- What to improve: Need better test data management
