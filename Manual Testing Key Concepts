Module 1.1
ERROR (Due to Human mistake)
    ↓
DEFECT/BUG (Usually In code)
    ↓
FAILURE (A System crash or wrong output from an Application)

Real World Example:
ERROR: Developer types "if (age > 18)" instead of "if (age >= 18)" while coding an application
DEFECT: Code contains wrong logic
FAILURE: 18-year-old users can't register in the Application(Could result to Revenue losses, etc)

VERIFICATION: "Are we building the product right?"
- Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs
- Checks process compliance
- Example: Code review to check coding standards

VALIDATION: "Are we building the right product?"
- Actual testing against business requirements
- End-user perspective
- Example: Testing to ensure the "login" feature works as Users expect

QA vs QC(Diff)
QA (Process-oriented):
- Proactive
- Preventing defects
- Process improvement
- Example: Creating test standards, code review checklists

QC (Product-oriented):
- Reactive
- Finding defects
- Testing actual product
- Example: Executing test cases, reporting bugs

Module 1.2: Software Development Life Cycle (60 min)
Key SDLC Models
1. Waterfall Model

Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
     ↓           ↓           ↓            ↓          ↓
   (Sequential - each phase completes before next begins)
Usage: Regulated industries e.g Healthcare, Government etc
QA Entry Point: After development completes
Pros: Clear documentation, structured
Cons: Late bug discovery, inflexible to changes

2. Agile/Scrum Model 
Sprint Planning → Development + Testing → Review → Retrospective
        ↓                                    ↑
        └─────────────── (Repeat) ──────────┘
        
Sprints last = 2-4 weeks of work (Total Project SDLC timeline broken down into Sprints)
Real-World Agile Sprint Example:
Day 1-2: Sprint Planning
- User story: "As a user, I want to login with email and password"
- Acceptance criteria defined
- QA reviews requirements, asks questions

Day 3-8: Development + Testing (Parallel)
- Developer codes login feature
- QA writes test cases
- QA tests each completed component
- Daily standup: "I'm testing login API, found 2 bugs"

Day 9: Sprint Review
- Demo to stakeholders
- QA presents test results: 45 test cases, 5 bugs found, 4 fixed

Day 10: Retrospective
- What went well: Early QA involvement caught design issues
- What to improve: Need better test data management

V-Model (Common in regulated industries)
Requirements ←→ Acceptance Testing
     ↓                    ↑
System Design ←→ System Testing
     ↓                    ↑
Detailed Design ←→ Integration Testing
     ↓                    ↑
Coding ←→ Unit Testing

Module 1.3: Testing Levels (45 min)
1. Unit Testing (Developer responsibility, but QA should understand)
# What it looks like
def calculate_total(price, quantity, discount):
    """Calculate order total with discount"""
    subtotal = price * quantity
    return subtotal - (subtotal * discount / 100)

# Unit test
def test_calculate_total():
    assert calculate_total(100, 2, 10) == 180  # 200 - 10% = 180
    assert calculate_total(50, 1, 0) == 50      # No discount
    assert calculate_total(100, 0, 10) == 0     # Zero quantity
```

**What QA tests here:** 
- Review unit test coverage reports
- Suggest edge cases developers might miss
- Verify critical business logic has unit tests

---

#### **2. Integration Testing** (QA heavily involved)

**Real Example: E-commerce Checkout**
```
Component A: Shopping Cart
Component B: Payment Gateway  
Component C: Inventory System
Component D: Email Service

Integration Test Scenarios:
1. Cart sends order to Payment Gateway
   - Test: Does total amount match?
   - Test: Are all items included?

2. Payment Gateway confirms payment
   - Test: Does Inventory get reduced?
   - Test: Does confirmation email send?

3. Failed payment scenario
   - Test: Is cart preserved?
   - Test: Is inventory NOT reduced?
   - Test: Does error email send?
```

**Common Integration Bugs:**
- Data format mismatch (Cart sends "$100.00", API expects 10000 cents)
- Timing issues (Email sends before payment confirms)
- Missing error handling (API timeout not handled)

---

#### **3. System Testing** (QA primary responsibility)

**Testing entire application end-to-end**

**Example: Online Banking System Test**
```
Test Scenario: Fund Transfer

Preconditions:
- User A has account with $1000
- User B has account with $500

Test Steps:
1. Login as User A
2. Navigate to Transfer Money
3. Enter User B's account number
4. Enter amount: $200
5. Enter password for confirmation
6. Submit transfer

Expected Results:
✓ Transfer confirmation message appears
✓ User A balance: $800
✓ User B balance: $700
✓ Transaction appears in both histories
✓ Email sent to both users
✓ Transaction ID generated

Verify also:
✗ Can't transfer more than available balance
✗ Can't transfer to invalid account
✗ Can't transfer negative amounts
✗ Session timeout works during transfer
```

---

#### **4. Acceptance Testing** (Business validation)

**Types:**

**User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
```
Real users test in production-like environment

Example: New search feature
- Marketing team tests: "Can I search by brand?"
- Sales team tests: "Can I filter by price range?"
- Customer support tests: "Are results relevant?"

Pass criteria: 90% of users say "Yes, this works for my needs"
```

**Alpha Testing:**
- Internal company users test
- Office environment
- Developers present to fix bugs immediately

**Beta Testing:**
```
Example: Mobile App Beta Program

Phase 1: Closed Beta (100 users)
- Controlled group
- Active feedback collection
- Week 1-2

Phase 2: Open Beta (10,000 users)
- Public can join
- Gather crash reports, feedback
- Week 3-6

Metrics tracked:
- Crash rate
- User retention
- Feature usage
- Bug reports
```

### **Module 1.5: Bug Severity vs Priority (30 min)**

**Critical Matrix:**
```
                HIGH PRIORITY          LOW PRIORITY
              ┌──────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
CRITICAL      │ P0: Drop everything  │ P2: Important   │
SEVERITY      │ (App crashes)        │ (Typo on        │
              │                      │  homepage)       │
              ├──────────────────────┼─────────────────┤
LOW           │ P1: Fix soon         │ P3: Nice to have│

```

---

### **Module 1.6: Types of Testing (45 min)**

#### **Functional Testing**
Testing what the system does

**Categories:**

**1. Smoke Testing** (Build Verification)
```
Quick test to verify basic functionality works

Example: E-commerce smoke test (15 minutes)
✓ Homepage loads
✓ Can login
✓ Can search products
✓ Can add to cart
✓ Can initiate checkout

Purpose: Decide if build is stable enough for detailed testing
When: After each new build/deployment
```

**2. Sanity Testing** (Focused verification)
```
Narrow, deep testing of specific functionality

Example: After fixing "login with email" bug
✓ Login with valid email ✓
✓ Login with invalid email ✓
✓ Login with email (uppercase) ✓
✓ Login with email (spaces) ✓
✓ SQL injection in email field ✓
✗ Don't test cart, checkout (unrelated)

Purpose: Verify specific fix works
When: After bug fix, before full regression
```

**3. Regression Testing**
```
Ensure new changes didn't break existing functionality

Example: After adding "Guest Checkout" feature

Full Regression Suite (200 test cases):
- Login/Logout (20 cases)
- Product Search (30 cases)
- Shopping Cart (40 cases)
- Checkout - Registered User (50 cases)
- Checkout - Guest User (30 cases) ← NEW
- Payment Processing (30 cases)

Focus areas:
✓ All existing checkout flows still work
✓ Guest checkout doesn't break registered flow
✓ Cart persistence works for both user types
```

**4. Exploratory Testing**
```
Unscripted testing, learning while testing

Session Charter: "Explore image upload feature for 60 minutes"

What I'll look for:
- File type handling
- File size limits
- Multiple uploads
- Upload cancellation
- Progress indicators
- Error messages

Notes during exploration:
[00:10] Uploaded PNG - works ✓
[00:15] Uploaded 50MB file - no size warning ⚠️
[00:22] Uploaded .exe file - accepted! BUG 🐛
[00:35] Rapid multiple uploads - race condition, one file lost BUG 🐛
[00:45] Progress bar stuck at 99% for large files BUG 🐛

Result: 3 bugs found, filed as SHOP-1240, SHOP-1241, SHOP-1242
```

---

#### **Non-Functional Testing**

**1. Performance Testing**
```
Response time, throughput, resource usage

Example: API Performance Requirements
- Average response time: < 200ms
- 95th percentile: < 500ms
- 99th percentile: < 1000ms
- Throughput: 1000 requests/second

Test: Load 1000 concurrent users for 10 minutes
Results:
Average: 180ms ✓
95th: 450ms ✓
99th: 1200ms ✗ FAILS requirement
Throughput: 950 req/sec ✗ FAILS requirement

Bottleneck found: Database query not indexed
```

**2. Load Testing**
```
System behavior under expected load

Example: E-commerce site during normal traffic
- Expected users: 1000 concurrent
- Test duration: 1 hour
- User actions: Browse (60%), Add to cart (30%), Checkout (10%)

Results:
✓ All pages load < 3 seconds
✓ No errors under normal load
✓ Database CPU: 60% (healthy)
✓ Application servers: 40% (healthy)
```

**3. Stress Testing**
```
Find breaking point

Example: Push system beyond limits
Start: 1000 users
Increase by 500 every 5 minutes

Results:
1000 users: All good ✓
1500 users: Some slow responses (3-4 sec)
2000 users: Occasional errors (5%)
2500 users: Many errors (20%), some timeouts
3000 users: System unresponsive, database locks

Breaking point: 2500 users
Recommendation: Scale infrastructure before reaching 2000 concurrent
```

**4. Usability Testing**
```
Is it user-friendly?

Example: New mobile app navigation

Test: Give 10 users tasks, observe
Task 1: "Find your order history"
- 8/10 users found it < 30 seconds ✓
- 2/10 users confused, took 2 minutes ✗

Task 2: "Change delivery address"
- 3/10 users found it < 1 minute ✗
- 7/10 users gave up, asked for help ✗✗

Finding: "Change delivery address" needs better visibility
Solution: Add to main menu instead of nested in settings
```

**5. Compatibility Testing**
```
Works across environments

Browser Matrix:
Chrome ✓, Firefox ✓, Safari ✓, Edge ✓
IE 11 ✗ (layout broken)

Mobile:
iOS 16 ✓, iOS 15 ✓, Android 13 ✓, Android 11 ✗ (crashes)

Screen resolutions:
1920x1080 ✓, 1366x768 ✓, 375x667 (iPhone) ✓
320x568 (small phone) ✗ (buttons overlap)
```

**6. Security Testing**
```
Protect against attacks

Tests:
✓ SQL Injection: Tried ' OR '1'='1, properly escaped
✓ XSS: Tried <script>alert('XSS')</script>, sanitized
✗ CSRF: No token on state-changing operations BUG
✗ Password policy: Accepts "123456" BUG
✓ Session timeout: Works after 30 min inactivity
✗ API: No rate limiting, vulnerable to DDoS BUG

Improvement: Add validation message "Special characters not allowed"
```

---

### **Test Scenario 2: Filter Functionality (45 min)**

**TC-010: Multiple Filters**
```
Scenario: Apply multiple filters and verify results

Steps:
1. Search for "London"
2. Apply filters:
   - Price: £50-£100
   - Star rating: 4+ stars
   - Free cancellation: Yes
   - Distance from center: < 1 km
3. Scroll through results

Verification:
✓ Do ALL results match filter criteria?
✓ Check first 10 results:
   Result 1: £___, ⭐___, Cancellation: ___, Distance: ___
   Result 2: ...
   
⚠️ Look for violations
```

**TC-011: Filter Edge Cases**
```
Test these:
1. Set price filter min = max (£50-£50)
2. Select ALL meal plan options
3. Select conflicting filters (if any)
4. Remove filters one by one (do results update?)
5. Clear all filters quickly

EXPECTED BUG TO FIND:
- Filters might not apply correctly
- Results might not update
- Price filter might show properties outside range
```

**TC-012: Filter Persistence**
```
Test flow:
1. Apply filters: 4⭐, Free WiFi, Pool
2. Click on a property
3. Click browser back button
4. Check filters

Expected: Filters still applied
Actual: ?

Then:
5. Refresh page (F5)
6. Check filters

Expected: Filters persist (or are in URL)
Actual: ?
```

---

**🔍 REAL BUG YOU'LL FIND:**
```
Title: Price filter shows properties outside selected range

Severity: Major
Priority: High
Component: Search/Filters

Steps:
1. Search "Paris"
2. Set price filter: $100-$150
3. Scroll through results
4. Click "Show all prices" button on property cards

Expected: All properties shown should be $100-$150 for selected dates
Actual: Found property showing $189 per night

Root cause: Filter shows "starting from" price, but different dates have different prices

Screenshot: [Attach showing $189 property in $100-$150 filtered results]

Recommendation: Filter should be based on user's selected dates, not lowest available price
```

---

### **Test Scenario 3: Property Details Page (45 min)**

**TC-020: Image Gallery**
```
Test:
1. Open any property
2. Click main image to open gallery
3. Navigate through images:
   - Click next arrow 20 times
   - Click previous arrow
   - Click on thumbnail
   - Use keyboard arrows
   - Swipe on mobile (DevTools)

- Any console errors?
```

**TC-021: Room Selection**
```
Scenario: Select different room options

1. Pick property with multiple room types
2. For each room type, check:
   ✓ Price displays correctly
   ✓ Amenities listed
   ✓ Max occupancy shown
   ✓ Photos available
3. Try selecting:
   - 1 room
   - 2 rooms of same type
   - Multiple room types

2. Apply review filters:
   - Solo traveler
   - Families
   - Rating: 9+
3. Sort by:
   - Most recent
   - Highest score
   - Lowest score

Verify:
✓ Do filtered reviews match criteria?
✓ Does sorting work correctly?
✓ Read 5 reviews, check if rating matches content

EXPECTED BUG:
- Review filter might not work properly
- Dates might be incorrect
- Translation issues
```

---

**🔍 REAL BUG YOU'LL FIND:**
```
Title: Image gallery counter shows wrong total after filtering

Steps:
1. Open property with 50+ photos
2. Open gallery
3. Filter by "Room" photos only (now shows 12 photos)
4. Navigate to last image
5. Observe counter

Expected: Shows "12 of 12"
Actual: Shows "12 of 50"

Severity: Minor
Priority: Low

Additional: When clicking "Next" on image 12, it shows image 13 (from unfiltered set)
This is confusing UX - counter suggests 12 photos but you can access more
```

---

### **Test Scenario 4: Booking Flow (60 min)**

**TC-030: Guest Checkout**
```
Full booking simulation (DON'T actually book):

1. Select property and room
2. Click "Reserve"
3. Enter guest details:
   - First name
   - Last name  
   - Email
   - Phone
4. Enter payment details (use test credit card numbers)
5. Stop before final confirmation

Test variations:
- Leave fields empty (one at a time)
- Enter invalid emails:
  * "invalidemail"
  * "test@"
  * "test@domain"
  * "@domain.com"
  * <script>alert('xss')</script>@test.com
- Enter invalid phone:
  * Letters: "abcd1234"
  * Special chars: "+++++++"
  * Too short: "123"
- Enter invalid names:
  * Numbers: "12345"
  * Very long: 500 characters
  * SQL injection: "Robert'); DROP TABLE users;--"
```

**TC-031: Payment Validation**
```
Test credit card field with:

Valid formats (test cards - DON'T use real):
✓ 4111 1111 1111 1111 (Visa test)
✓ 5500 0000 0000 0004 (Mastercard test)

Invalid formats:
✗ 1234 5678 9012 3456
✗ 4111-1111-1111-1111 (with dashes)
✗ 4111111111111111 (no spaces)
✗ Letters: aaaa bbbb cccc dddd
✗ Script: <script>alert('xss')</script>

Verify:
- Does validation work?
- What error messages appear?
- Can you bypass client-side validation using DevTools?
```

**TC-032: Total Price Verification**
```
Critical test - verify price calculation:

1. Note room price: $___
2. Number of nights: ___
3. Number of rooms: ___
4. Note taxes/fees: $___
5. Check total: $___

Manual calculation:
(Room price × Nights × Rooms) + Taxes = Expected total

Does it match shown total? Yes/No

Test edge cases:
- Long stays (30 nights) - does price change?
- Multiple rooms (5+ rooms) - discounts applied?
- Different dates - weekday vs weekend pricing
```

---

**🔍 REAL CRITICAL BUG YOU'LL FIND:**
```
Title: Can modify booking total by manipulating request payload

Severity: CRITICAL
Priority: URGENT
Component: Payment Processing

Steps:
1. Add room to cart: $200/night × 2 nights = $400
2. Proceed to payment page
3. Open DevTools → Network tab
4. Fill payment form but don't submit
5. Right-click on payment request → Edit and Resend
6. Change JSON payload: "totalAmount": 400 → "totalAmount": 1
7. Send modified request

Expected: Server validates and rejects modified amount
Actual: [NEED TO TEST - might accept modified amount]

Security Impact: HIGH
- Financial loss for business
- Users could book rooms for $1

Recommendation:
- Server MUST recalculate total from:
  * Property ID
  * Room ID  
  * Check-in/check-out dates
  * Number of rooms
- Never trust client-provided total
```

---

### **Test Scenario 5: Mobile Responsiveness (45 min)**

**Setup:**

**Test Case Best Practices:**

✅ **DO:**
- Write clear, unambiguous steps
- Use active voice ("Click login button")
- Include all necessary test data
- Specify expected results precisely
- Make test cases independent (not dependent on other tests)
- Include setup (preconditions) and cleanup steps

❌ **DON'T:**
- Be vague ("Test login feature")
- Assume knowledge ("Login normally")
- Combine multiple scenarios in one test case
- Skip expected results
- Make tests dependent on execution order

---

**Good vs Bad Test Case Examples:**

**❌ Bad Test Case:**

Test Case: Login test
Steps: Login with correct credentials
Expected: Should work


**✅ Good Test Case:**

Test Case ID: TC-LOGIN-001

### **Module 2.2: Equivalence Partitioning (45 min)**

**Concept:**
Divide input data into groups (partitions) where the system should behave the same way. Test one value from each partition instead of testing every possible value.

**Example: Age Input Field (18-65 allowed)**

**Partitions:**

Invalid partition 1: Age < 18    (Examples: 0, 5, 17)
Valid partition:     Age 18-65   (Examples: 18, 35, 65)
Invalid partition 2: Age > 65    (Examples: 66, 100, 120)


**Test Cases (only 3 needed instead of testing every age):**

TC-AGE-001: Test with age = 17 (Invalid partition 1)
Expected: Error message "Must be 18 or older"

TC-AGE-002: Test with age = 35 (Valid partition)
Expected: Input accepted, proceed to next step

TC-AGE-003: Test with age = 66 (Invalid partition 2)
Expected: Error message "Maximum age is 65"


---

**Real Example: E-commerce Discount Code**

**Requirement:**

Discount codes:

    SAVE10: 10% off orders $50-$100
    SAVE20: 20% off orders $100-$500
    SAVE30: 30% off orders $500+
    WINTER: $15 flat discount, any order


**Equivalence Partitions:**

Code validity:

    Valid codes: SAVE10, SAVE20, SAVE30, WINTER
    Invalid codes: INVALID, EXPIRED123, empty, special chars

Order amount for SAVE10:

    Below minimum: $0-$49.99
    Valid range: $50-$100
    Above range: $100.01+

Order amount for SAVE20:

    Below minimum: $0-$99.99
    Valid range: $100-$500
    Above range: $500.01+


**Test Cases:**

TC-DISC-001: Valid code "SAVE10" with order $75 (valid range)
Expected: 10% discount applied, total = $67.50

TC-DISC-002: Valid code "SAVE10" with order $45 (below minimum)
Expected: Error "Code SAVE10 requires minimum $50 order"

TC-DISC-003: Valid code "SAVE10" with order $150 (above range)
Expected: Error "Code SAVE10 valid for orders up to $100"

TC-DISC-004: Invalid code "EXPIRED" with order $75
Expected: Error "Invalid discount code"

TC-DISC-005: Empty code field with order $75
Expected: Error "Please enter discount code" OR proceeds without discount

TC-DISC-006: Code "WINTER" with order $25
Expected: $15 discount applied, total = $10

TC-DISC-007: Code "WINTER" with order $10
Expected: $15 discount applied, total = $0 OR error "Cannot exceed order total"


---

**Exercise: Apply Equivalence Partitioning**

**Scenario: Password Field Requirements**

Password must:

    Be 8-20 characters long
    Contain at least 1 uppercase letter
    Contain at least 1 lowercase letter
    Contain at least 1 number
    Contain at least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*)


**Your turn - identify partitions:**

Length partitions:

    Too short: ___
    Valid: ___
    Too long: ___

Character type partitions:

    Missing uppercase: ___
    Missing lowercase: ___
    Missing number: ___
    Missing special char: ___
    Has all required types: ___


**Solution:**

TC-PASS-001: Length too short (5 chars) "Ab1!"
Expected: Error "Password must be at least 8 characters"

TC-PASS-002: Length valid (12 chars), all requirements "Password123!"
Expected: Password accepted

TC-PASS-003: Length too long (25 chars) "Password123!ExtraCharacters"
Expected: Error "Password must be maximum 20 characters"

TC-PASS-004: Valid length, missing uppercase "password123!"
Expected: Error "Password must contain uppercase letter"

TC-PASS-005: Valid length, missing lowercase "PASSWORD123!"
Expected: Error "Password must contain lowercase letter"

TC-PASS-006: Valid length, missing number "Password!!!"
Expected: Error "Password must contain number"

TC-PASS-007: Valid length, missing special char "Password123"
Expected: Error "Password must contain special character"

TC-PASS-008: Valid length, all requirements "MyPass123!"
Expected: Password accepted


---

### **Module 2.3: Boundary Value Analysis (45 min)**

**Concept:**
Bugs often occur at boundaries. Test at the edge of equivalence partitions.

**Boundary Testing Rules:**

For range A to B, test:

    Just below A (A-1)
    Exactly A
    Just above A (A+1)
    Middle value
    Just below B (B-1)
    Exactly B
    Just above B (B+1)


**Example: Quantity Field (1-10 items allowed)**

**Boundaries:**

Lower boundary = 1
Upper boundary = 10

Test values:
0  (lower boundary - 1) ❌
1  (lower boundary)     ✓
2  (lower boundary + 1) ✓
5  (middle value)       ✓
9  (upper boundary - 1) ✓
10 (upper boundary)     ✓
11 (upper boundary + 1) ❌


**Test Cases:**

TC-QTY-001: Quantity = 0
Input: 0
Expected: Error "Minimum quantity is 1" OR field doesn't accept 0

TC-QTY-002: Quantity = 1
Input: 1
Expected: Accepted, can add to cart

TC-QTY-003: Quantity = 2
Input: 2
Expected: Accepted, can add to cart

TC-QTY-004: Quantity = 10
Input: 10
Expected: Accepted, can add to cart

TC-QTY-005: Quantity = 11
Input: 11
Expected: Error "Maximum quantity is 10" OR field doesn't accept 11

TC-QTY-006: Quantity = -1
Input: -1
Expected: Error "Quantity must be positive" OR field doesn't accept negative

TC-QTY-007: Quantity = 999
Input: 999
Expected: Error "Maximum quantity is 10"

**Real Example: Flight Booking - Passenger Age**

**Business Rules:**

Infant: 0-2 years (lap child, no seat)
Child: 2-12 years (discounted fare)
Adult: 12-64 years (standard fare)
Senior: 65+ years (discounted fare)


**Boundary Values to Test:**

Boundaries: 0, 2, 12, 65

Test cases:
TC-AGE-001: Age = -1 (invalid)
Expected: Error "Invalid age"

TC-AGE-002: Age = 0 (infant lower boundary)
Expected: Classified as Infant, no seat assigned

TC-AGE-003: Age = 1 (infant middle)
Expected: Classified as Infant

TC-AGE-004: Age = 2 (boundary: infant/child)
Expected: Class ified as Child (or Infant - clarify requirement!)
🚨 This is a critical test! Business must decide: is 2 infant or child?

TC-AGE-005: Age = 3 (child confirmed)
Expected: Classified as Child, child fare applied

TC-AGE-006: Age = 11 (child upper boundary - 1)
Expected: Classified as Child

TC-AGE-007: Age = 12 (boundary: child/adult)
Expected: Classified as Adult (or Child - clarify!)
🚨 Critical boundary!

TC-AGE-008: Age = 13 (adult confirmed)
Expected: Classified as Adult, standard fare

TC-AGE-009: Age = 64 (adult upper boundary)
Expected: Classified as Adult

TC-AGE-010: Age = 65 (boundary: adult/senior)
Expected: Classified as Senior, senior discount applied

TC-AGE-011: Age = 66 (senior confirmed)
Expected: Classified as Senior

TC-AGE-012: Age = 120 (extreme value)
Expected: Either accepted or error "Please verify age"


**Key Learning:**
Boundary testing often reveals ambiguous requirements! Age 2 and 12 need clarification from business.

### **Module 2.4: Decision Table Testing (60 min)**

**Concept:**
For testing complex business rules with multiple conditions and different actions based on combinations of conditions.

**When to Use:**
- Multiple input conditions
- Different combinations produce different outcomes
- Complex business logic

**Example: Loan Approval System**

**Business Rules:**

Loan approved IF:

    Credit score >= 700 AND
    Income >= $50,000 AND
    Debt-to-income ratio < 40%

Special cases:

    Existing customer with good history: Credit score >= 650
    High income (>$150k): Debt ratio can be up to 45%


**Decision Table:**

Conditions               | Rule1 | Rule2 | Rule3 | Rule4 | Rule5 | Rule6
------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------

Income >= $50,000       |   Y   |   Y   |   N   |   Y   |   N   |   N
Debt Ratio < 40%        |   Y   |   N   |   Y   |   Y   |   Y   |   Y
------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------
Actions                 |       |       |       |       |       |
------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------
Approve Loan            |   X   |       |       |       |       |

### **Module 2.5: State Transition Testing (45 min)**

**Concept:**
Test how a system behaves when transitioning between different states based on events/inputs.

**When to Use:**
- System has distinct states
- Behavior changes based on current state
- Events trigger state changes

**Example: Order Status Workflow**

**States:**

    Pending Payment
    Payment Confirmed
    Processing
    Shipped
    Delivered
    Cancelled
    Refunded


**State Transition Diagram:**

┌─────────────┐
│   Pending   │
│   Payment   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Payment Received
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Payment   │──────→ Cancel ──→ Refunded
│  Confirmed  │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Start Processing
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│ Processing  │──────→ Cancel ──→ Refunded
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Dispatch
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Shipped   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Delivery Confirmed
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  Delivered  │──────→ Return ──→ Refunded
└─────────────┘


**State Transition Table:**

Current State    | Event              | Next State        | Actions
-----------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------
Pending Payment  | Payment Received   | Payment Confirmed | Send confirmation email
Pending Payment  | Cancel Order       | Cancelled         | Release reserved items
Payment Confirmed| Start Processing   | Processing        | Notify warehouse
Payment Confirmed| Cancel Order       | Refunded          | Process refund
Processing       | Dispatch Order     | Shipped           | Send tracking number
Processing       | Cancel Order       | Refunded          | Stop processing, refund
Shipped          | Delivery Confirmed | Delivered         | Request review
Delivered        | Return Request     | Refunded          | Create return label


**Test Cases - Valid Transitions:**

TC-STATE-001: Pending → Payment Confirmed
Precondition: Order in "Pending Payment" state
Action: Submit payment (credit card approved)
Expected:

    State changes to "Payment Confirmed"
    Confirmation email sent
    Payment receipt generated
    Order summary page shows "Payment Confirmed"

TC-STATE-002: Payment Confirmed → Processing
Precondition: Order in "Payment Confirmed" state
Action: Warehouse starts processing order
Expected:

    State changes to "Processing"
    Customer receives "We're preparing your order" email
    Items reserved in inventory
    Estimated processing time displayed

TC-STATE-003: Processing → Shipped
Precondition: Order in "Processing" state
Action: Order dispatched by warehouse
Expected:

    State changes to "Shipped"
    Tracking number generated and sent to customer
    Estimated delivery date shown
    Inventory updated

TC-STATE-004: Shipped → Delivered
Precondition: Order in "Shipped" state
Action: Delivery confirmed by courier
Expected:

    State changes to "Delivered"
    Customer receives delivery confirmation
    Review request sent after 3 days
    Return window starts (30 days)


**Test Cases - Invalid Transitions (Negative Testing):**

TC-STATE-NEG-001: Try to ship order still in "Pending Payment"
Precondition: Order in "Pending Payment" state
Action: Attempt to mark as "Shipped"
Expected:

    Error: "Cannot ship order without payment confirmation"
    State remains "Pending Payment"
    No shipping notification sent

TC-STATE-NEG-002: Try to cancel order already "Delivered"
Precondition: Order in "Delivered" state
Action: Attempt to cancel order
Expected:

    Error: "Cannot cancel delivered order. Please request return instead"
    State remains "Delivered"
    Shows "Request Return" button instead

TC-STATE-NEG-003: Try to confirm delivery for order in "Processing"
Precondition: Order in "Processing" state
Action: Attempt to mark as "Delivered"
Expected:

    Error: "Order must be shipped before delivery confirmation"
    State remains "Processing"
    Invalid state transition logged

TC-STATE-NEG-004: Try to process refund for "Pending Payment" order
Precondition: Order in "Pending Payment" state
Action: Attempt to issue refund
Expected:

    Error: "No payment received. Order will be cancelled instead."
    State changes to "Cancelled" (not Refunded)
    No refund processed


**Test Cases - Edge Cases:**

TC-STATE-EDGE-001: Multiple rapid state changes
Precondition: Order in "Payment Confirmed"
Actions (rapid succession):

    Click "Cancel Order"
    Immediately, warehouse starts processing Expected:

    System should handle race condition
    Either: Cancellation succeeds (prevents processing)
    Or: Processing succeeds (prevents cancellation)
    One action must be rejected with clear error
    No orphaned state

TC-STATE-EDGE-002: Payment confirmation timeout
Precondition: Order in "Pending Payment" for 24 hours
Action: Time passes, no payment received
Expected:

    Auto-transition to "Cancelled" after 24 hours
    Inventory released
    Customer notified: "Your order was cancelled due to payment timeout"

TC-STATE-EDGE-003: Lost shipment scenario
Precondition: Order "Shipped" for 30 days, no delivery
Action: Customer reports non-delivery
Expected:

    System allows re-shipment or refund
    Investigation workflow triggered
    State: "Shipped - Under Investigation"
    Customer service can manually transition to "Refunded"

### **4. LinkedIn Post - Day 2**

🎯 Day 2 Complete: Test Case Design Mastery!

Just finished designing a comprehensive test suite with 55+ test cases for Spotify Web Player. This was intense but incredibly valuable!

📋 What I accomplished:

    55 professionally documented test cases
    Applied 4 systematic test design techniques
    Covered 7 major functional modules
    Prioritized by risk (P0/P1/P2)
    Created full traceability matrix

🎓 Techniques mastered:
✅ Equivalence Partitioning - Reduced 1000s of possible tests to manageable set
✅ Boundary Value Analysis - Found edge cases where bugs hide
✅ Decision Table Testing - Handled complex business logic
✅ State Transition Testing - Mapped system workflows

💡 Key insight:
Good test case design is about working smarter, not harder. By using equivalence partitioning, I tested email validation with 8 test cases instead of testing every possible email format. That's the power of systematic testing!

📊 Test Coverage:

    Authentication: 10 cases
    Search: 10 cases
    Playback: 10 cases
    Playlists: 10 cases
    Social features: 5 cases
    Edge cases: 5 cases

🔍 Example:
Instead of randomly testing playlist features, I mapped state transitions:
Empty Playlist → Add Songs → Reorder → Remove Songs → Delete Playlist

Each transition got specific test cases with expected behavior.

Tomorrow: Execute these test cases and document actual results!

3. EXECUTE test steps
   - Follow steps exactly as written
   - Document each step result
   - Take screenshots at key points
   - Note any deviations
   
4. COMPARE actual vs expected
   - Does actual match expected?
   - Any unexpected behavior?
   - Any error messages?
   - Any performance issues?
   
5. DOCUMENT result
   - Mark Pass/Fail
   - Add actual result details
   - Attach evidence (screenshots)
   - Note execution time
   
6. IF BUG FOUND:
   - Stop execution
   - Document bug immediately

   - Record reproduction steps
   - Assign severity/priority
   - Continue to next test case
   
7. CLEAN UP
   - Reset test environment
   - Clear test data
   - Prepare for next test

Test Execution Best Practices:

✅ DO:

    Execute tests in a clean browser (Incognito/Private mode)
    Take screenshots BEFORE and AFTER each action
    Document exact error messages (copy-paste, not paraphrase)
    Note timestamps when relevant
    Test one thing at a time
    Be methodical and patient
    Question everything - "Is this correct behavior?"

❌ DON'T:

    Rush through test cases
    Skip steps thinking you know the outcome
    Assume something works without testing
    Test in a browser with many extensions
    Use your personal Amazon account
    Make assumptions about expected behavior
    Ignore minor issues

### **Module 3.2: Bug Report Writing (60 min)**

**Anatomy of a Perfect Bug Report:**

**1. Bug Title (Clear, Concise, Specific)**

❌ **Bad Examples:**
- "Search not working"
- "Filter issue"
- "Website broken"
- "Found a problem"

✅ **Good Examples:**
- "Price filter $500-$700 displays products up to $849.99"
- "Product image fails to load on Safari 17.1 for iPhone 15 Pro listing"
- "Checkout button remains disabled after entering valid payment info"
- "Shopping cart shows incorrect total when applying 20% discount code"

**Formula for good title:**
```
[Component/Feature] + [Specific Issue] + [Context if needed]

Examples:
"[Search Results] Display irrelevant products when searching with special characters"
"[Shopping Cart] Remove button unresponsive on mobile (375x667 screen)"
"[Checkout] State dropdown missing entries for Puerto Rico and Guam"

BUG REPORT

BUG ID: BUG-AMZ-001
TITLE: Price filter $500-$700 displays products outside selected range
REPORTED BY: Your Name
DATE: 2025-01-15
STATUS: New

---

SEVERITY: Major
PRIORITY: High
COMPONENT: Search & Filters
AFFECTS VERSION: Amazon.com Live (accessed 2025-01-15)
BROWSER: Chrome 120.0.6099.130
OS: Windows 11 Pro (22H2)
SCREEN RESOLUTION: 1920x1080

---

DESCRIPTION:
When applying price range filter ($500-$700) to laptop search results, 
multiple products with prices exceeding the maximum threshold ($700) 
are displayed in the filtered results. This violates the filter criteria 
and provides incorrect results to users.

---

PRECONDITIONS:
1. User is on Amazon homepage (https://www.amazon.com)
2. User is not logged in (tested with logged out state)
3. Browser cache cleared before test
4. No other filters applied initially

---

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Navigate to https://www.amazon.com
2. Enter "laptop" in the search box
3. Click search button (or press Enter)
4. Wait for results page to load
5. In left sidebar, locate "Price" filter section
6. Click on "$500 to $700" price range option
7. Wait for page to reload with filtered results
8. Scroll through first 20 results
9. Observe product prices displayed

---

EXPECTED RESULT:
- All displayed products should have prices between $500.00 and $700.00 (inclusive)
- Products priced below $500.00 should not appear
- Products priced above $700.00 should not appear
- Filter should apply to all visible results consistently
- If a product has multiple price options, the starting/lowest price should be within range

---

ACTUAL RESULT:
- Majority of products are within $500-$700 range (correct)
- However, several products exceed $700 maximum:
  * Position #3: Dell Inspiron 15 - $749.99
  * Position #7: HP Pavilion Gaming - $799.99
  * Position #12: Lenovo ThinkPad - $849.99
  * Position #18: ASUS VivoBook - $729.99
- Filter header shows "Price: $500 to $700" indicating filter is active
- URL shows: "&rh=p_36:50000-70000" (price range in cents)
- No error messages displayed

---

Video: Full reproduction from start to finish (2 min 15 sec)
[Attach: video_amz_bug_001.mp4]

---

FREQUENCY: Always reproducible
- Tested 3 times with same search term: Issue appears every time
- Tested with different search terms ("computer", "notebook"): Issue persists
- Tested in Firefox 121: Same issue occurs
- Tested in incognito mode: Issue still present

---

WORKAROUND: None
Users cannot reliably filter by price range. Must manually check each product price.

---

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- User Experience: High - Users rely on filters for purchase decisions
- Business Impact: Medium - May lead to user frustration, cart abandonment
- Affected Users: All users using price filters (estimated high volume)
- Financial Impact: Potential lost sales if users cannot find products in budget

---

ROOT CAUSE (SUSPECTED):
Possible causes:
1. Filter query not properly restricting results in database query
2. Caching issue - old unfiltered results being served
3. Sponsored/promoted products bypassing filter logic
4. Frontend and backend filter logic mismatch
5. Issue with price data format (cents vs dollars)

Note: Dell laptop ($749.99) has small "Sponsored" label - sponsored products may bypass filters

---

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Issue does NOT occur with other filter types (Brand filter works correctly)
- Issue does NOT occur on price ranges below $500 (tested $200-$300 range - works)
- Browser console shows no JavaScript errors
- Network tab shows filter request returns status 200 OK
- Some products show price ranges (e.g., "$699-$899") - displaying lowest price, 
  but actual configuration exceeds filter max

---

REGRESSION RISK: High
If this is a new issue, recent code changes to filtering logic should be investigated.

---

SUGGESTED FIX:
1. Verify database query WHERE clause properly filters by max price
2. Ensure sponsored products respect filter criteria
3. For products with price ranges, verify base model price is within filter
4. Add server-side validation that all returned results meet filter criteria

---

RELATED BUGS: None found in existing bug database

---

TEST DATA USED:
- Search term: "laptop"
- Price filter: $500 to $700
- Test URL after filter applied:
  https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptop&rh=p_36:50000-70000

### **Module 3.3: Effective Screenshot Documentation (30 min)**

**Why Screenshots Matter:**
```
Good screenshot = Developer can see bug without reading
Bad screenshot = Developer says "Cannot reproduce"
```

---

**Screenshot Best Practices:**

**1. BEFORE Action Screenshot:**
```
Scenario: Testing "Add to Cart" button

BEFORE screenshot should show:
✓ Full product page visible
✓ "Add to Cart" button clearly visible
✓ Product price visible
✓ Product title visible
✓ Cursor NOT hovering over button (shows default state)
✓ Browser address bar visible (shows URL)
✓ Timestamp visible (Windows taskbar clock)

Filename: 01_before_click_add_to_cart.png
```

**2. DURING Action Screenshot (if relevant):**
```
Scenario: Button hover state bug

DURING screenshot should show:
✓ Cursor positioned over button
✓ Hover state visible (or bug: hover state not working)
✓ Any tooltips that appear
✓ Any visual changes

Filename: 02_during_hover_add_to_cart.png
```

**3. AFTER Action Screenshot:**
```
Scenario: "Add to Cart" result

AFTER screenshot should show:
✓ Result of action (cart updated or error message)
✓ Any confirmation messages
✓ Changed UI elements (cart icon count increased)
✓ New page state

Filename: 03_after_click_add_to_cart.png
```

**4. ERROR Screenshot:**
```
If error occurs:
✓ Full error message visible (don't cut off text)
✓ Context: where error appeared
✓ Browser console open (F12) showing errors
✓ Network tab showing failed requests (if network issue)
✓ Full stack trace if visible

Filename: 04_error_cart_update_failed.png
```

---

**Screenshot Annotation Best Practices:**

Use annotation tools to highlight issues:

**Tool Options:**
- Windows: Snipping Tool with built-in annotations
- Mac: Screenshot app (Cmd+Shift+5) with markup
- Browser Extension: Awesome Screenshot
- Software: ShareX (free, Windows), Skitch (Mac)

**Annotation Types:**
```
🔴 Red Circle/Box = Highlight the bug location
"Product shows $749.99 but filter is $500-$700"

➡️ Red Arrow = Point to specific element
"Arrow pointing to price that violates filter"

📝 Text Label = Explain what's wrong
"Expected: $500-$700 | Actual: $749.99"

❌ Red X = Mark incorrect elements
"X over product that shouldn't appear"

✅ Green Check = Mark correct elements (for comparison)
"✓ This product ($659.99) is correct"

🔢 Numbers = Sequence of steps
"1. Clicked here  2. Then this appeared  3. Error here"
```

**Example Annotated Screenshot Description:**
```
Screenshot: "filter_bug_annotated.png"

Annotations:
1. Red box around "$500 to $700" filter (shows filter is active)
2. Red circle around Dell laptop priced at $749.99
3. Red arrow pointing from filter to violating product
4. Text label: "VIOLATION: $749.99 > $700.00 max"
5. Green check on product priced at $659.99 for comparison
6. Number labels showing scroll position: "Result #3 of 20 reviewed"
```

---

**Screenshot Naming Convention:**
```
Format: [BugID]_[Sequence]_[Description]_[Timestamp].png

Examples:
BUG-AMZ-001_01_filter_applied_143522.png
BUG-AMZ-001_02_product_749_violation_143525.png
BUG-AMZ-001_03_console_errors_143530.png

Why this format:
- BugID: Groups all screenshots for same bug
- Sequence: Shows order of reproduction
- Description: Explains what screenshot shows
- Timestamp: Useful for correlating with logs
```

---

**What to Capture in Screenshots:**

**✅ Always Include:**
- Browser address bar (shows URL, site authenticity)
- Page header/navigation (shows context, location on site)
- Relevant content (the actual bug)
- System clock (Windows taskbar or Mac menu bar)
- Browser version visible (if possible, or note separately)

**✅ Often Useful:**
- Browser console (F12 → Console tab) if JavaScript errors
- Network tab (F12 → Network) if loading issues
- Entire page (full-page screenshot) for layout bugs
- Multiple browser tabs (if bug relates to tab switching)
- Mouse cursor position (for interaction bugs)

**❌ Avoid:**
- Screenshots with personal information (your name, address, payment info)
- Blurry screenshots (check focus before saving)
- Screenshots cut off mid-text (show complete error messages)
- Screenshots too small (minimum 1280px width)
- Screenshots with desktop clutter (close unrelated apps)

---

**Full Page Screenshots (Beyond Viewport):**

Some bugs require showing entire page:

**Methods:**

**Chrome/Edge:**
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Click "..." menu (top-right of DevTools)
3. Click "Run command" (or Ctrl+Shift+P)
4. Type "screenshot"
5. Select "Capture full size screenshot"
```

**Firefox:**
```
1. Right-click page
2. Select "Take a Screenshot"
3. Click "Save full page"
```

**Extensions:**
- "GoFullPage" (Chrome, Firefox)
- "Awesome Screenshot" (All browsers)

### **Module 3.4: Video Recording for Complex Bugs (15 min)**

**When to Record Video:**

✅ **Record video for:**
- Intermittent bugs (happens randomly)
- Timing/animation issues
- Multi-step workflows
- Race conditions
- Performance problems (lag, stuttering)
- Complex interactions (drag & drop, gestures)
- Bugs that are hard to explain in text
- Bugs involving audio/video playback

❌ **Don't need video for:**
- Simple visual bugs (wrong color, typo)
- Static layout issues
- Bugs easily shown in 1 screenshot

---

**Video Recording Tools (Free):**

**1. Loom (Recommended for beginners)**
- Website: loom.com
- Free tier: 25 videos, 5 min each
- Records screen + webcam + audio
- Auto-uploads, generates shareable link
- Good for: Quick bug reproduction videos

**2. OBS Studio (Advanced, unlimited)**
- Website: obsproject.com
- Completely free, open source
- Records unlimited length
- High quality
- More complex setup
- Good for: Detailed, professional recordings

**3. Built-in Tools:**
- **Windows 11:** Xbox Game Bar (Win+G → Capture)
- **Mac:** QuickTime Player (File → New Screen Recording)
- **Limited but works for simple cases**

---

**Video Recording Best Practices:**

**BEFORE Recording:**
```
✓ Close unnecessary browser tabs
✓ Close unnecessary applications
✓ Disable notifications (Focus Assist on Windows, Do Not Disturb on Mac)
✓ Clear browser history/cache if showing fresh test
✓ Prepare test data (don't waste video time preparing)
✓ Practice reproduction once (ensure you know steps)
✓ Set resolution to 1920x1080 if possible
```

**DURING Recording:**
```
✓ Speak clearly: Narrate what you're doing
   "Now I'm clicking the Add to Cart button..."
   "Expected: Cart count increases. Actual: No response"
   
✓ Move mouse slowly and deliberately
✓ Pause slightly after each action (shows result)
✓ Point out bugs verbally as they occur
✓ Show browser console if relevant
✓ Keep video focused (don't show unrelated actions)
✓ Target 2-5 minutes max (viewers' attention span)
```

**AFTER Recording:**
```
✓ Trim unnecessary beginning/end
✓ Add title card (simple text overlay) with:
   - Bug ID
   - Bug title
   - Date recorded
   
✓ Upload to:
   - Loom (generates link automatically)
   - Google Drive (share with link)
   - GitHub (add to bug report)
   
✓ Add video link to bug report
✓ Add timestamp markers in bug report
   "0:15 - Applied price filter"
   "0:32 - Bug appears: $749 product visible"
   "0:45 - Checking other results shows more violations"
```

---

**Video Script Template:**
```
[Start Recording]

"Hello, this is [Your Name] reporting bug AMZ-001.

I'm going to demonstrate the price filter bug where products
outside the selected range are displayed.

Starting from Amazon homepage..."

[Navigate to amazon.com]

"Now I'm searching for 'laptop'..."

[Type and search]

"Search results are loading... and we can see hundreds of laptops.

Now I'm applying the price filter: $500 to $700..."

[Click filter]

"Filter is applied. The page is reloading. 

Notice the URL now shows the price range parameter.

Now I'm scrolling through the results.

First few products look correct... $599, $649, $679...

But wait, here at position number 3, we have a Dell laptop
priced at $749.99. This is $49.99 over the maximum.

Let me take a closer look..."

[Hover over product, show price clearly]

"Yes, definitely $749.99. This should not appear.

Scrolling further... here's another one. $799.99 HP laptop.

And another: $849.99 Lenovo.

So we have at least 3 products violating the filter in
just the first 20 results.

This demonstrates the bug clearly.

The filter claims to show $500-$700 range, but products
up to $849 are appearing.

End of demonstration. Thank you."

[Stop Recording]

**🚨 CRITICAL BUG FOUND DURING EXECUTION:**
````markdown
BUG REPORT

BUG ID: BUG-AMZ-002
TITLE: "Add to Cart" confirmation popup blocks product page interaction
REPORTED BY: Your Name
DATE: 2025-01-15 10:05:26
STATUS: New

SEVERITY: Minor (S3)
PRIORITY: Medium (P2)
COMPONENT: Shopping Cart / Product Page
BROWSER: Chrome 120.0.6099.130
OS: Windows 11

DESCRIPTION:
After clicking "Add to Cart", a confirmation popup appears.
However, the popup does NOT have a backdrop/overlay, so the 
product page behind it is still visible and appears clickable.

If user tries to click behind the popup (on the product page),
clicks pass through to background, causing unintended actions.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Navigate to any product page
2. Click "Add to Cart" button
3. Confirmation popup appears: "Added to Cart"
4. WITHOUT closing popup, try to click on product image behind popup
5. Observe behavior

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Either: Popup should have semi-transparent overlay preventing clicks
- Or: Clicks on background should be blocked
- Or: Clicking background should close popup

ACTUAL RESULT:
- Clicks pass through popup to elements behind
- Clicked on product image → Product page image viewer opened
- Popup still visible over image viewer
- Creates confusing layered UI
- User loses context

SCREENSHOTS:
1. tc_amz_003_popup_no_overlay.png - Shows popup without backdrop
2. tc_amz_003_click_through_bug.png - Shows image viewer opened behind popup

IMPACT:
- User Experience: Confusing interaction
- Frequency: Happens every time
- Workaround: Close popup before interacting with page
- Severity: Minor (doesn't break functionality, just poor UX)

RECOMMENDATION:
Add semi-transparent overlay behind popup, or prevent clicks on background elements while popup is open.

PRIORITY JUSTIFICATION:
Medium priority because:
- Affects all users adding to cart
- Creates confusion
- Easy to fix (add CSS overlay)
- Not blocking (user can close popup)

BUG REPORT

BUG ID: BUG-AMZ-003
TITLE: Setting cart quantity to "0" doesn't remove item or show error
REPORTED BY: Your Name
DATE: 2025-01-15 10:15:55
STATUS: New

SEVERITY: Minor (S3)
PRIORITY: Medium (P2)
COMPONENT: Shopping Cart - Quantity Management

DESCRIPTION:
When user sets product quantity to "0" in shopping cart,
the system accepts the input but behaves inconsistently.

Expected: Item should be removed from cart OR show error "Quantity must be at least 1"
Actual: Quantity shows "0", price shows "$0.00", but item remains in cart

PRECONDITIONS:
1. At least one product in shopping cart
2. On cart page: https://www.amazon.com/gp/cart/view.html
3. Product has quantity dropdown/input available

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Go to shopping cart (must have item in cart)
2. Click quantity dropdown
3. Select "10+" to enable custom input
4. Clear quantity field
5. Enter "0"
6. Press Enter or click outside field to trigger update
7. Observe behavior

EXPECTED RESULT:
Option A: Item removed from cart automatically with message "Item removed"
Option B: Error message "Quantity must be at least 1", quantity reverts to "1"
Option C: Quantity input doesn't accept "0" (validation prevents it)

ACTUAL RESULT:
- Quantity updates to "0"
- Item line shows: "Logitech M510 Mouse - Qty: 0 - $0.00"
- Item remains in cart (not removed)
- Cart icon still shows "1 item"
- Subtotal shows "$0.00"
- No error message displayed
- "Delete" link still available next to item

IMPACT:
- User Confusion: Item appears in cart with 0 quantity
- Inconsistent State: Cart says "1 item" but subtotal is $0
- Checkout Impact: Cannot proceed to checkout with $0 cart (tested)
- Workaround: User must click "Delete" link to actually remove item

SCREENSHOTS:
1. tc_amz_005_entering_zero.png - Entering 0 in quantity
2. tc_amz_005_qty_zero_result.png - Result showing 0 qty, $0.00
3. tc_amz_005_cart_icon_still_shows_1.png - Cart icon inconsistency

FREQUENCY: Always reproducible (tested 3 times)

ROOT CAUSE (SUSPECTED):
- Frontend validation missing for minimum quantity (should be 1)
- Backend accepts 0 as valid quantity
- "Remove from cart" logic not triggered for 0 quantity
- System treats 0 as different from "delete"

SEVERITY JUSTIFICATION: Minor
- Doesn't break checkout (can't proceed with $0 cart)
- User can still delete item manually
- Edge case (most users use Delete button)
- Causes confusion but not data loss

PRIORITY JUSTIFICATION: Medium
- Inconsistent user experience
- Easy to fix (add validation: if qty < 1, remove item)
- Affects user trust in cart accuracy
- Should be fixed to prevent confusion

RECOMMENDATION:
Add frontend validation:
```javascript
if (quantity < 1) {
  removeItemFromCart();
  showMessage("Item removed from cart");
}
```

Or server-side:
````
if quantity <= 0:
    delete cart_item
    return message: "Item removed"

RELATED TEST CASES:

    Related to cart management logic

TESTED IN:

    Chrome 120: Bug present
    Firefox 121: Bug present (cross-browser issue)

BUSINESS IMPACT:

    Low immediate impact
    Potential for user complaints
    Cart appears broken to user
    Reduces trust in cart functionality

- Conversion rate
- Cart abandonment
- First-time buyer acquisition

NOT FLAGGING AS BUG:
This appears to be intentional business decision.
Documenting for stakeholder awareness.

DAY 4: INTRODUCTION TO TEST AUTOMATION - SELENIUM WEBDRIVER
MORNING SESSION (4 hours): Automation Fundamentals + Environment Setup
Module 4.1: Why Test Automation? (30 min)

The Reality of Manual Testing:

Scenario: E-commerce Product Search Testing

Manual Testing:
- Open browser
- Navigate to site
- Enter search term
- Click search
- Verify results
- Take screenshot
- Document results
- Close browser

Time per test: 3-5 minutes
Test 100 search variations: 5-8 hours
Repeat for every release: Unsustainable

Automation:
- Write script once
- Run 100 variations: 10 minutes
- Run on every release: Automatic
- Run overnight: No human needed

When to Automate (Decision Matrix):

✅ AUTOMATE These:

    Tests run frequently (regression suite)
    Tests with multiple data sets (login with 50 users)
    Repetitive tests (same steps, different data)
    Tests across multiple browsers/devices
    Tests that are error-prone when manual (complex calculations)
    Smoke tests (run before every deployment)
    Performance/load testing
    Tests that run overnight/weekends

❌ DON'T AUTOMATE These:

    Tests run once or rarely
    Exploratory testing (creative, discovery-based)
    Usability testing (requires human judgment)
    Tests for features that change frequently (maintenance cost high)
    Tests with unclear requirements
    Visual design verification (color, layout aesthetics)
    Tests that cost more to automate than manual execution

Automation ROI Example:

Manual Test Suite:
- 500 test cases
- Each takes 2 minutes to execute
- Total execution time: 1000 minutes (16.6 hours)
- Run frequency: Every release (2 weeks)
- Tester cost: $30/hour
- Annual cost: 26 releases × 16.6 hours × $30 = $12,948

Automated Test Suite:
- Initial automation: 80 hours × $30 = $2,400
- Maintenance: 10 hours/month × $30 × 12 = $3,600
- Execution: Free (runs automatically)
- Annual cost: $2,400 + $3,600 = $6,000

Savings Year 1: $12,948 - $6,000 = $6,948
Savings Year 2+: $12,948 - $3,600 = $9,348 annually

Break-even point: ~5 months

Automation Pyramid:

        ╱────╲
       ╱  UI  ╲         10% - Slow, brittle, expensive
      ╱────────╲              E2E user workflows
     ╱   API    ╲       30% - Faster, more stable
    ╱────────────╲            API/service layer tests
   ╱    UNIT      ╲     60% - Fast, cheap, stable
  ╱────────────────╲          Function/component tests
 ╱──────────────────╲

UI Tests: Test through browser (Selenium)
API Tests: Test backend services (RestAssured, Postman)
Unit Tests: Test code functions (JUnit, pytest)

Why pyramid shape?
- Unit tests: Fast (milliseconds), many tests
- API tests: Medium speed (seconds), moderate tests  
- UI tests: Slow (minutes), fewer tests

Module 4.2: Selenium Architecture (45 min)

What is Selenium?

Selenium is an open-source framework for automating web browsers. It allows you to programmatically control browser actions (click, type, navigate) and verify page content.

Selenium Components:

1. Selenium WebDriver
   - Core component that controls browsers
   - Sends commands to browser
   - Different drivers for different browsers

2. Selenium IDE (optional)
   - Browser extension for record/playback
   - Good for quick prototypes
   - Not suitable for complex automation

3. Selenium Grid (advanced)
   - Run tests in parallel across machines
   - Test on multiple browsers simultaneously
   - Used for scalability

We'll focus on: Selenium WebDriver

How Selenium Works:

Your Python Script
       ↓
   Selenium WebDriver API
       ↓
   Browser Driver (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver)
       ↓
   Browser (Chrome, Firefox)
       ↓
   Actual Webpage

Detailed Flow:
python

# Your code:
driver.find_element(By.ID, "search-box").send_keys("laptop")

# What happens:
1. Python Selenium library receives your command
2. Translates to WebDriver protocol (JSON over HTTP)
3. Sends command to ChromeDriver executable
4. ChromeDriver translates to Chrome DevTools Protocol
5. Chrome browser executes: Find element, type "laptop"
6. Chrome returns result to ChromeDriver
7. ChromeDriver returns to Selenium
8. Selenium returns to your Python script

Example command flow:
json

// Selenium sends to ChromeDriver:
POST /session/abc123/element
{
  "using": "id",
  "value": "search-box"
}

// ChromeDriver responds:
{
  "value": {
    "element-6066-11e4-a52e-4f735466cecf": "element-xyz789"
  }
}

// Then Selenium sends:
POST /session/abc123/element/element-xyz789/value
{
  "text": "laptop"
}

// ChromeDriver executes typing, responds:
{
  "value": null
}

Locator Strategies:

Selenium finds elements using various strategies:

1. ID (Most reliable if available)
html

<input id="email-input" type="email">

python

element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "email-input")

2. Name
html

<input name="username" type="text">

python

element = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "username")

3. Class Name
html

<button class="btn-primary">Submit</button>

python

element = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "btn-primary")

4. Tag Name
html

<button>Click Me</button>

python

element = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "button")

5. Link Text (for links)
html

<a href="/login">Sign In</a>

python

element = driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "Sign In")

6. Partial Link Text
html

<a href="/products">View All Products</a>

python

element = driver.find_element(By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT, "Products")

7. CSS Selector (Very powerful)
html

<div class="product" data-id="123">
  <span class="price">$29.99</span>
</div>

python

# By class
element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".product .price")

# By attribute
element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "[data-id='123']")

# By hierarchy
element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.product > span.price")

8. XPath (Most powerful, most complex)
html

<div id="products">
  <div class="product">
    <h3>Laptop</h3>
    <span class="price">$799</span>
  </div>
</div>

python

# Absolute path (not recommended - brittle)
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "/html/body/div[1]/div[2]/span")

# Relative path (better)
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@class='product']//span[@class='price']")

# By text content
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//h3[text()='Laptop']")

# By contains
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//span[contains(@class, 'price')]")

Locator Strategy Best Practices:

Priority Order:

    ID - Most reliable, unique, fast
    Name - Usually unique, fast
    CSS Selector - Flexible, fast, readable
    XPath - Most powerful, but slowest
    Class/Tag Name - Only if element is unique
    Link Text - Only for links

Bad Locators (Avoid):
python

# Too specific - breaks if page structure changes
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "/html/body/div[3]/div[1]/form/div[2]/input")

# Too generic - might find wrong element
driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "button")

# Depends on text that might change
driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "Click here to login now!")

Good Locators:
python

# Unique ID - stable
driver.find_element(By.ID, "login-button")

# Data attributes designed for testing
driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "[data-test-id='login-btn']")

# Relative XPath with stable attributes
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit' and @name='login']")

Module 4.3: Python Basics for Automation (45 min)

Essential Python Concepts:

1. Variables and Data Types
python

# Strings
username = "testuser@example.com"
password = "TestPass123!"
url = "https://www.amazon.com"

# Numbers
quantity = 5
price = 29.99
total = quantity * price  # 149.95

# Booleans
is_logged_in = True
has_items_in_cart = False

# Lists (arrays)
test_emails = ["test1@example.com", "test2@example.com", "test3@example.com"]
search_terms = ["laptop", "mouse", "keyboard"]

# Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
user_data = {
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "Pass123!",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
}

# Accessing values
print(user_data["email"])  # Output: test@example.com

2. Conditionals (If/Else)
python

# Basic if statement
if element.is_displayed():
    print("Element is visible")
    element.click()
else:
    print("Element is not visible")

# If-elif-else

    print("Adult")
    
# Logical operators
is_prime_member = True
has_credit_card = True
if is_prime_member and has_credit_card:
    print("Eligible for special offer")

3. Loops
python

# For loop - iterate over list
test_urls = ["https://amazon.com", "https://ebay.com", "https://walmart.com"]
for url in test_urls:
    driver.get(url)
    print(f"Testing: {url}")

# For loop - with range
for i in range(5):  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    print(f"Test iteration {i}")

# For loop - with index and value
products = ["Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard"]
for index, product in enumerate(products):
    print(f"{index}: {product}")

# While loop
attempts = 0
while attempts < 3:
    try:
        element.click()
        break  # Exit loop if successful
    except:
        attempts += 1
        print(f"Attempt {attempts} failed")

4. Functions
python

# Basic function
def login(email, password):
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "email").send_keys(email)
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "password").send_keys(password)
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "login-button").click()

# Using the function
login("test@example.com", "Pass123!")

# Function with return value
def get_product_price(product_name):
    element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, f"//h3[text()='{product_name}']/..//span[@class='price']")
    price_text = element.text  # "$29.99"
    price = float(price_text.replace("$", ""))  # 29.99
    return price

# Using function with return
laptop_price = get_product_price("Dell Laptop")
print(f"Laptop costs: ${laptop_price}")

# Function with default parameters
def search_product(term, category="All Departments"):
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "search-box").send_keys(term)
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "category-dropdown").select_by_visible_text(category)
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "search-button").click()

# Can call with or without category
search_product("laptop")  # Uses default "All Departments"
search_product("laptop", "Electronics")  # Uses specified category

5. Exception Handling
python

# Try-except block
try:
    element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "popup-close")
    element.click()
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("No popup to close")

# Multiple exception types
try:
    element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "submit-button")
    element.click()
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Button not found")
except ElementNotInteractableException:
    print("Button not clickable")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

# Try-except-finally
try:
    driver.get("https://amazon.com")
    # Test code here
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Test failed: {e}")
finally:
    driver.quit()  # Always runs, even if exception occurs

6. String Operations (Important for testing)
python

# String concatenation
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # "John Doe"

# String formatting (modern way)
email = f"{first_name.lower()}.{last_name.lower()}@example.com"
# "john.doe@example.com"

# String methods
text = "  Hello World  "
print(text.strip())  # "Hello World" - removes whitespace
print(text.upper())  # "  HELLO WORLD  "
print(text.lower())  # "  hello world  "
print(text.replace("World", "Python"))  # "  Hello Python  "

# String operations in tests
actual_price = "$29.99"
expected_price = 29.99
actual_numeric = float(actual_price.replace("$", "").replace(",", ""))
assert actual_numeric == expected_price

# String contains
page_title = driver.title
assert "Amazon" in page_title  # Check if "Amazon" is in title

# Split strings
full_text = "Product Name: Dell Laptop, Price: $799"
parts = full_text.split(", ")  # ["Product Name: Dell Laptop", "Price: $799"]
price_part = parts[1]  # "Price: $799"

7. Lists Operations
python

# Creating lists
products = ["Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard"]

# Accessing elements
first_product = products[0]  # "Laptop"
last_product = products[-1]  # "Keyboard"

# Adding elements
products.append("Monitor")  # ["Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard", "Monitor"]

# Removing elements
products.remove("Mouse")  # ["Laptop", "Keyboard", "Monitor"]

# Length of list
num_products = len(products)  # 3

# Check if item in list
if "Laptop" in products:
    print("Laptop found")

# List slicing
first_two = products[0:2]  # ["Laptop", "Keyboard"]

# Real test example: Verify search results
search_results = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "product-title")
result_texts = [element.text for element in search_results]  # List comprehension
print(f"Found {len(result_texts)} products")
for result in result_texts:
    assert "laptop" in result.lower(), f"Irrelevant result: {result}"
```

```

---

**Step 2: Install IDE (Visual Studio Code)**

**Why VS Code?**
- Free and open-source
- Excellent Python support
- Built-in terminal
- Git integration
- Extensions for testing

**Installation:**
```
1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Download for your OS
3. Run installer
4. Accept defaults
5. Launch VS Code

6. Install Python extension:
   - Click Extensions icon (left sidebar, square icon)
   - Search "Python"
   - Click "Python" by Microsoft
   - Click "Install"
   
7. Configure Python:
   - Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Select Python 3.11.x from list

Step 3: Create Project Structure

Open Terminal in VS Code:

    View → Terminal (or Ctrl+`)

Create folder structure:
bash

# Create main project folder
mkdir selenium-automation
cd selenium-automation

# Create subfolders
mkdir tests
mkdir pages
mkdir utils
mkdir reports
mkdir screenshots

# Create files
touch tests/__init__.py
touch pages/__init__.py
touch utils/__init__.py
touch requirements.txt
touch README.md

# Verify structure
# Your folder should look like:
selenium-automation/
├── tests/
│   └── __init__.py
├── pages/
│   └── __init__.py
├── utils/
│   └── __init__.py
├── reports/
├── screenshots/
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md

What each folder is for:

    tests/ - Your test scripts
    pages/ - Page Object Model classes (Day 9)
    utils/ - Helper functions
    reports/ - Test execution reports
    screenshots/ - Test evidence

Step 4: Install Selenium

Create requirements.txt:
txt

# requirements.txt
selenium==4.16.0
webdriver-manager==4.0.1
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-html==4.1.1

Install packages:
bash

# Make sure you're in selenium-automation folder
# Install all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
pip list

# Should see:
# selenium          4.16.0
# webdriver-manager 4.0.1
# pytest           7.4.3
# pytest-html      4.1.1
# ... and their dependencies

What we installed:

    selenium - Main automation library
    webdriver-manager - Automatically manages browser drivers (no manual download needed!)
    pytest - Testing framework (better than unittest)
    pytest-html - Generates HTML test reports

Step 5: Verify Selenium Installation

Create test file: tests/test_installation.py
python

"""
Test file to verify Selenium installation is working correctly.
This script opens Amazon, verifies the title, then closes.
"""

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

        print("✓ Browser maximized")
        
        # Step 3: Navigate to Amazon
        print("Navigating to Amazon...")
        driver.get("https://www.amazon.com")
        time.sleep(3)  # Wait for page to load
        print("✓ Amazon loaded")
        
        # Step 4: Verify page title
        title = driver.title
        print(f"Page title: {title}")
        assert "Amazon" in title, f"Expected 'Amazon' in title, got: {title}"
        print("✓ Title verification passed")
        
        # Step 5: Find search box (verify element interaction)
        search_box = driver.find_element(By.ID, "twotabsearchtextbox")
        assert search_box.is_displayed(), "Search box not visible"
        print("✓ Search box found and visible")
        
        # Step 6: Take screenshot
        screenshot_path = "screenshots/installation_test.png"
        driver.save_screenshot(screenshot_path)
        print(f"✓ Screenshot saved: {screenshot_path}")
        
        print("\n✅ All checks passed! Selenium is installed correctly.")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ Test failed: {e}")
        driver.save_screenshot("screenshots/installation_error.png")
        raise
    
    finally:
        # Step 7: Close browser
        print("Closing browser...")
        driver.quit()
        print("✓ Browser closed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_selenium_installation()

Run the test:
bash

# In terminal, from selenium-automation folder
python tests/test_installation.py

# Expected output:
# Starting Selenium installation test...
# Setting up Chrome driver...
# ✓ Chrome driver initialized
# ✓ Browser maximized
# Navigating to Amazon...
# ✓ Amazon loaded
# Page title: Amazon.com. Spend less. Smile more.
# ✓ Title verification passed
# ✓ Search box found and visible
# ✓ Screenshot saved: screenshots/installation_test.png
# ✅ All checks passed! Selenium is installed correctly.
# Closing browser...
# ✓ Browser closed
```

**What happened:**
1. Chrome browser opened automatically
2. Navigated to Amazon
3. Verified title contains "Amazon"
4. Found search box element
5. Took screenshot
6. Closed browser

**If you see this output and browser opened/closed: Your installation is successful! ✅**

---

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

**Issue 1: "chromedriver not found"**
```
Solution: webdriver-manager should handle this automatically.
If it still fails, manually download:
1. Check Chrome version: chrome://settings/help
2. Download matching ChromeDriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
3. Place in PATH or specify location in code

Issue 2: "selenium module not found"
bash

# Reinstall selenium
pip uninstall selenium
pip install selenium==4.16.0

# Verify
python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.__version__)"
```

**Issue 3: "Browser doesn't open"**
```
Check:
1. Chrome is installed (if using Chrome)
2. No other browser instances stuck
3. Antivirus not blocking

Try Firefox instead:
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager
driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=Service(GeckoDriverManager().install()))

Issue 4: "Permission denied" on macOS/Linux
bash

# Install with user permissions
pip install --user selenium

# Or use virtual environment (better practice)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

### **Understanding the Test Code:**

**1. Class-Based Test Structure:**
```python
class TestAmazonSearch:
    """All tests for Amazon search functionality grouped together"""
```

Why use classes?
- Organizes related tests
- Can share setup/teardown
- Easier to run specific test groups

**2. Fixtures (Setup/Teardown):**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def driver(self):
    # SETUP: Runs before each test
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(...)
    driver.maximize_window()
    
    yield driver  # Test runs here
    
    # TEARDOWN: Runs after each test (even if test fails)
    driver.quit()
```

Why fixtures?
- Avoid code duplication
- Ensures cleanup even if test fails
- Can be reused across tests

**3. Explicit Waits (Better than time.sleep):**
```python
# Bad (fixed wait, wastes time):
time.sleep(10)  # Always waits 10 seconds

# Good (smart wait, maximum 10 seconds):
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".results"))
)
# Proceeds as soon as element appears, or fails after 10 seconds
```

**4. Implicit Wait (Global timeout):**
```python
driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # Set once, applies to all find_element calls
```

**5. Parametrized Tests (Data-Driven):**
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("search_term,expected_results_min", [
    ("laptop", 100),
    ("mouse", 50),
])
def test_search_multiple_products(self, driver, search_term, expected_results_min):
    # This test runs twice: once with "laptop", once with "mouse"
```

Benefits:
- One test code, multiple data sets
- Easy to add more test cases
- Clear test results for each data set

### **Technique 2: Taking Screenshots on Failure**

**Create file: `conftest.py`** (pytest configuration file)
````python
"""
pytest configuration file

"""

import pytest
from datetime import datetime
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
import os

@pytest.fixture
def driver(request):
    """Global driver fixture with automatic screenshot on failure"""
    print("\n🔧 Setting up browser...")
    service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)
    driver.maximize_window()
    driver.implicitly_wait(10)
    
    yield driver
    
    # This runs after test completes
    # Check if test failed

### **Technique 3: Running Tests in Headless Mode**

**Modify driver fixture for headless execution:**
````python
# In conftest.py or individual test file

from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

def driver():
    """Driver with headless option"""
    service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())
    
    # Configure Chrome options
    options = Options()
    options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run without GUI
    options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
    options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
    options.add_argument("--window-size=1920,1080")
    
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=options)
    driver.implicitly_wait(10)
    
    yield driver
    
    driver.quit()

# Run tests in background (faster, good for CI/CD)
# Browser won't open, tests run faster

    Browsers Tested: Chrome 120, Firefox 121
    Screenshots Captured: 54

Test Coverage by Module
Module	Tests	Pass	Fail	Skip
Search	10	10	0	0
Product Details	7	7	0	0
Shopping Cart	6	5	0	1
Cross-Browser	4	4	0	0
Key Features Implemented
1. Data-Driven Testing
python

@pytest.mark.parametrize("search_term,expected_results_min", [
    ("laptop", 100),
    ("mouse", 50),
])

Tests run multiple times with different data sets
2. Fixtures for Reusability
python

@pytest.fixture
def driver():
    # Setup browser
    yield driver
    # Teardown browser

Eliminates code duplication
3. Custom Wait Helpers
python

wait_for_element_clickable(driver, By.ID, "button")

Smart waits instead of fixed time.sleep()
4. Automatic Screenshot on Failure

Tests automatically capture screenshots when they fail
5. Page Object Model (Coming in Day 9)

Structured approach for maintainable automation
Project Highlights
Real-World Test Scenarios

✅ Search with special characters
✅ Search with no results ✅ Add/remove cart items ✅ Update quantities ✅ Calculate subtotals ✅ Cart persistence
Best Practices Implemented

✅ Explicit waits (not time.sleep)
✅ Exception handling
✅ Clear assertions with messages
✅ Descriptive test names
✅ Helper methods for reusability
✅ Comprehensive logging
Common Issues & Solutions
Issue: ChromeDriver not found

Solution: webdriver-manager handles this automatically
python

from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())

Issue: Element not found

Solution: Use explicit waits
python

WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "element-id"))
)
````

### Issue: Tests fail intermittently
**Solution:** 
1. Increase wait times
2. Check for dynamic content
3. Use better locators (ID instead of XPath)

### **4. LinkedIn Post - Day 4**

🤖 Day 4: First Automation Scripts Running!

Today I wrote my first Selenium WebDriver automation! Watching tests run automatically and interact with Amazon.com felt like magic.

📊 What I Automated:

    25 test cases across 3 major modules
    29 total test executions (including data-driven tests)
    Runs completed in under 9 minutes
    96% pass rate

🎯 Key Achievements:

1. Data-Driven Testing One test code → Multiple data sets Instead of writing 5 similar tests, I used @pytest.mark.parametrize:
python

@pytest.mark.parametrize("search_term", [
    "laptop", "mouse", "keyboard", "headphones", "cable"
])
````
Result: 1 test = 5 executions automatically!

**2. Smart Waits**
Learned the difference between:
❌ time.sleep(10) - Always waits 10 seconds (waste of time)
✅ WebDriverWait - Waits maximum 10 seconds, proceeds as soon as element appears

This alone made tests 3x faster!

**3. Automatic Failure Handling**
Tests now automatically:
- Capture screenshots when they fail
- Log detailed error messages
- Generate HTML reports with evidence

**4. Cross-Browser Testing**
Same tests run on both Chrome AND Firefox automatically
pytest handles the complexity!

💡 Biggest "Aha!" Moment:

Understanding locators is CRITICAL. I learned:
- ID: Best (unique, fast)
- CSS Selector: Flexible, powerful
- XPath: Most powerful but slowest

Wrong locator = Flaky tests
Right locator = Stable tests

🐛 Real Bug Found:

While automating cart tests, discovered Amazon's quantity dropdown doesn't validate minimum value! You can set quantity to "0" and item stays in cart showing $0.00

This wouldn't happen in manual testing - automation forces you to think about edge cases!

📈 Test Results:
✅ Search: 10/10 passed
✅ Product Pages: 7/7 passed  
✅ Shopping Cart: 5/6 passed (1 skipped - "Save for Later" intermittent)
✅ Cross-Browser: 4/4 passed

⚡ Performance:
- 25 tests × 2 browsers = 50 test executions
- Completed in 8 minutes 45 seconds
- Generated 54 screenshots
- 3 detailed HTML reports

🔧 Tech Stack:
- Python 3.11
- Selenium WebDriver 4.16
- pytest framework
- webdriver-manager (auto driver management)
- Cross-browser: Chrome + Firefox

📚 Key Learnings:

1. **Automation is programming** - You MUST know Python fundamentals
2. **Waits are everything** - Master explicit waits or suffer flaky tests  
3. **Fixtures save time** - Setup/teardown once, use everywhere
4. **Locators matter more than you think** - Bad locator = maintenance nightmare

Tomorrow: Advanced techniques (Page Object Model, handling alerts, file uploads)

DAY 5: PLAYWRIGHT JAVASCRIPT - MODERN WEB AUTOMATION
MORNING SESSION (4 hours): Playwright Fundamentals + Environment Setup
Module 5.1: Why Playwright? Playwright vs Selenium (45 min)

What is Playwright?

Playwright is a modern, open-source automation framework developed by Microsoft. It's designed specifically for modern web applications and provides powerful features that Selenium lacks.

Playwright vs Selenium - Head-to-Head Comparison:

Feature                 | Playwright          | Selenium
------------------------|---------------------|---------------------
Speed                   | ⚡⚡⚡ Very Fast    | ⚡⚡ Moderate
Auto-wait               | ✅ Built-in        | ❌ Manual setup
Network Interception    | ✅ Yes             | ❌ Limited
Multiple Tabs/Windows   | ✅ Easy            | ⚠️ Complex
Browser Context         | ✅ Isolated        | ❌ Shared sessions
Screenshots/Videos      | ✅ Built-in        | ⚠️ External tools
API Testing             | ✅ Built-in        | ❌ Need separate tool
Mobile Emulation        | ✅ Excellent       | ⚠️ Basic
Debugging               | ✅ Inspector UI    | ⚠️ Console only
Setup                   | ✅ One command     | ⚠️ Multiple steps
Learning Curve          | ⚡ Moderate        | ⚡ Moderate
Community/Support       | 📚 Growing fast    | 📚 Very mature

Real-World Speed Comparison:

Same 25 Amazon tests:

Selenium (Day 4):
⏱️ 8 minutes 45 seconds

Playwright:
⏱️ 3 minutes 12 seconds (63% faster!)

Why? 
- Auto-waits eliminate unnecessary delays
- Parallel execution easier
- Faster browser communication
- Better resource management

Playwright Key Advantages:

1. Auto-Waiting (No more flaky tests!)
javascript

// Selenium - Manual waits needed
const button = await driver.wait(until.elementLocated(By.ID('button')), 10000);
await driver.wait(until.elementIsVisible(button), 10000);
await driver.wait(until.elementIsEnabled(button), 10000);
await button.click();

// Playwright - Automatic waiting!
await page.click('#button');
// Playwright automatically waits for:
// ✓ Element to exist
// ✓ Element to be visible
// ✓ Element to be enabled
// ✓ Element to be stable (not animating)

2. Browser Context Isolation (True test independence)
javascript

// Playwright - Each test gets fresh browser state
test('test 1', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://amazon.com');
  // Fresh cookies, cache, localStorage
});

test('test 2', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://amazon.com');
  // Completely isolated from test 1!
});

// Selenium - Tests share browser state (causes interference)

3. Network Interception (API mocking, monitoring)
javascript

// Playwright - Intercept and modify network requests
await page.route('**/api/products', route => {
  route.fulfill({
    status: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ products: mockData })
  });
});

// Selenium - Not possible without external proxy

4. Multiple Pages/Tabs (Easy)
javascript

// Playwright - Natural API
const newPage = await context.newPage();
await newPage.goto('https://amazon.com');

// Selenium - Complex window handle switching
const windows = await driver.getAllWindowHandles();
await driver.switchTo().window(windows[1]); // Error-prone

5. Built-in Test Runner
javascript

// Playwright has @playwright/test built-in
// No need for separate test framework like pytest/jest

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Everything included!
});
```

**When to Use Playwright vs Selenium:**

**✅ Use Playwright when:**
- Starting a new automation project
- Testing modern web apps (React, Angular, Vue)
- Need fast, reliable tests
- Want built-in API testing
- Need video recording of tests
- Testing responsive designs extensively
- Team comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript

**✅ Use Selenium when:**
- Existing large Selenium codebase
- Team expertise in Python/Java/C#
- Need mature ecosystem (10+ years of tools)
- Testing legacy applications
- Company mandate/standards require it
- Need mobile app testing (Appium built on Selenium)

**🎯 Best Practice: Use BOTH!**
- Playwright for new UI tests (fast, modern)
- Selenium for legacy support
- This bootcamp teaches both!

### **Module 5.2: Playwright Architecture (30 min)**

**How Playwright Works:**
```
Your JavaScript Test
       ↓
Playwright API (Node.js)
       ↓
Browser WebSocket Connection (Direct)
       ↓
Chromium/Firefox/WebKit
       ↓
Webpage

VS

Selenium Architecture:
Your Test → Selenium API → WebDriver → Browser Driver → Browser
(More layers = Slower + More points of failure)

Key Differences:

    Direct Browser Control:

javascript

// Playwright communicates directly with browser via WebSocket
// No intermediate driver process needed
// Result: Faster, more reliable

    Browser Context:

javascript

// Browser = Physical browser process
// Context = Isolated session (like incognito)
// Page = Individual tab

const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext(); // Isolated session
const page = await context.newPage(); // New tab

    Selector Engine:

javascript

// Playwright has smarter selectors
await page.click('text=Login'); // Click button with text "Login"
await page.click('button:has-text("Add to Cart")'); // CSS + text
await page.click('role=button[name="Submit"]'); // Accessibility-first

Module 5.3: JavaScript Essentials for Playwright (45 min)

Essential JavaScript Concepts:

1. Variables and Data Types
javascript

// Modern JavaScript uses const and let (not var)

// const - Cannot be reassigned
const url = "https://www.amazon.com";
const price = 29.99;
const isAvailable = true;

// let - Can be reassigned
let cartCount = 0;
cartCount = 1; // OK

// Arrays
const searchTerms = ["laptop", "mouse", "keyboard"];
searchTerms.push("monitor"); // Add item
console.log(searchTerms[0]); // "laptop"

// Objects (like Python dictionaries)
const user = {
  email: "test@example.com",
  password: "Pass123!",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};

console.log(user.email); // "test@example.com"
console.log(user["password"]); // "Pass123!"

2. Functions and Arrow Functions
javascript

// Traditional function
function login(email, password) {
  console.log(`Logging in with ${email}`);
}

// Arrow function (modern, preferred)
const login = (email, password) => {
  console.log(`Logging in with ${email}`);
};

// Arrow function with implicit return
const getPrice = (text) => parseFloat(text.replace('$', ''));

// Async function (for Playwright - EVERYTHING is async!)
const searchProduct = async (page, term) => {
  await page.fill('#search-box', term);
  await page.click('#search-button');
};

3. Async/Await (CRITICAL for Playwright)
javascript

// Playwright operations are asynchronous
// Must use await with async functions

// ❌ WRONG - Will not work!
const title = page.title();
console.log(title); // Promise { <pending> }

// ✅ CORRECT - Use await
const title = await page.title();
console.log(title); // "Amazon.com. Spend less. Smile more."

// Every Playwright action needs await:
await page.goto('https://amazon.com');
await page.fill('#search', 'laptop');
await page.click('button');
const text = await page.textContent('.price');

4. Template Literals (String interpolation)
javascript

// Old way
const message = "User " + username + " logged in at " + time;

// Modern way (use backticks `)
const message = `User ${username} logged in at ${time}`;

// Multi-line strings
const html = `
  <div>
    <h1>${title}</h1>
    <p>${description}</p>
  </div>
`;

5. Destructuring
javascript

// Object destructuring
const { email, password } = user;
console.log(email); // "test@example.com"

// Array destructuring
const [first, second] = searchTerms;
console.log(first); // "laptop"

// Common in Playwright tests
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
// Extracts chromium from playwright package

6. Conditional Statements
javascript

// If-else
if (await page.isVisible('#popup')) {
  await page.click('#close-popup');
} else {
  console.log('No popup to close');
}

// Ternary operator
const buttonText = isPrime ? 'Prime Member' : 'Join Prime';

// Nullish coalescing (??)
const searchTerm = userInput ?? 'laptop'; // Use 'laptop' if userInput is null/undefined

7. Loops
javascript

// For loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(`Iteration ${i}`);
}

// For...of (iterate over array)
const urls = ['https://amazon.com', 'https://ebay.com'];
for (const url of urls) {
  await page.goto(url);
  console.log(await page.title());
}

// Array methods (forEach, map, filter)
const prices = ['$10', '$20', '$30'];
const numeric = prices.map(p => parseFloat(p.replace('$', '')));
// [10, 20, 30]

8. Try-Catch (Error Handling)
javascript

try {
  await page.click('#popup-close', { timeout: 5000 });
} catch (error) {
  console.log('No popup appeared');
}

// Finally block (always runs)
try {
  await page.goto('https://amazon.com');
  // Test code
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Test failed: ${error.message}`);
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'error.png' });
} finally {
  await page.close(); // Always close, even if error
}
```

├── tests-examples/
│   └── demo-todo-app.spec.js
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── playwright.config.js    (configuration)

Step 4: Configure Playwright

Edit playwright.config.js:
javascript

// @ts-check
const { defineConfig, devices } = require('@playwright/test');

/**
 * @see https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration
 */
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // Test directory
  testDir: './tests',
  
  // Maximum time one test can run (30 seconds)
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
  
  // Fail the build on CI if you accidentally left test.only in the source code
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  
  // Retry on CI only
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  
  // Number of parallel workers
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : 4, // 4 tests in parallel locally
  
  // Reporter to use
  reporter: [
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    ['list'], // Console output
    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results.json' }]
  ],
  
  // Shared settings for all projects
  use: {
    // Base URL for page.goto('/')
    baseURL: 'https://www.amazon.com',
    
    // Browser options
    headless: false, // Show browser (set true for CI/CD)
    viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
    
    // Artifacts
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
    
    // Default timeout for actions (10 seconds)
    actionTimeout: 10 * 1000,
    navigationTimeout: 30 * 1000,
  },

  // Configure projects for major browsers
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
    
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    },
    
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    },
    
    // Mobile viewports
    {
      name: 'Mobile Chrome',
      use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] },
    },
    
    {
      name: 'Mobile Safari',
      use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] },
    },
  ],

  // Web Server for local dev (optional)
  // webServer: {
  //   command: 'npm run start',
  //   port: 3000,
  // },
});

Step 5: Verify Installation

Create test file: tests/installation-test.spec.js
javascript

/**
 * Installation verification test
 * Confirms Playwright is working correctly
 */

const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test.describe('Playwright Installation Tests', () => {
  
  test('should open Amazon and verify title', async ({ page }) => {
    console.log('🧪 Starting installation verification test...');
    
    // Step 1: Navigate to Amazon
    console.log('Step 1: Navigating to Amazon...');
    await page.goto('https://www.amazon.com');
    console.log('✓ Page loaded');
    
    // Step 2: Verify title
    console.log('Step 2: Verifying page title...');
    const title = await page.title();
    console.log(`Page title: ${title}`);
    
    expect(title).toContain('Amazon');
    console.log('✓ Title verification passed');
    
    // Step 3: Verify search box present
    console.log('Step 3: Checking search box...');
    const searchBox = page.locator('#twotabsearchtextbox');
    await expect(searchBox).toBeVisible();
    console.log('✓ Search box is visible');
    
    // Step 4: Take screenshot
    console.log('Step 4: Taking screenshot...');
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/installation-test.png', fullPage: true });
    console.log('✓ Screenshot saved: screenshots/installation-test.png');
    
    console.log('✅ All installation checks passed!');
  });
  
  test('should test browser context isolation', async ({ page, context }) => {
    console.log('🧪 Testing browser context isolation...');
    
    // Navigate to Amazon
    await page.goto('https://www.amazon.com');
    
    // Set a cookie in this context
    await context.addCookies([{
      name: 'test_cookie',
      value: 'test_value',
      domain: '.amazon.com',
      path: '/'
    }]);
    
    // Verify cookie exists
    const cookies = await context.cookies();
    const testCookie = cookies.find(c => c.name === 'test_cookie');
    
    expect(testCookie).toBeTruthy();
    expect(testCookie.value).toBe('test_value');
    
    console.log('✓ Cookie isolation working correctly');
    console.log('✅ Context isolation test passed!');
  });
  
  test('should verify auto-waiting functionality', async ({ page }) => {
    console.log('🧪 Testing Playwright auto-waiting...');
    
    // Navigate to Amazon
    await page.goto('https://www.amazon.com');
    
    // This will automatically wait for:
    // - Element to be attached to DOM
    // - Element to be visible
    // - Element to be enabled
    // - Element to be stable (not animating)
    // NO explicit wait needed!
    await page.click('#twotabsearchtextbox');
    await page.fill('#twotabsearchtextbox', 'laptop');
    
    console.log('✓ Auto-waiting works - no explicit waits needed!');
    
    // Verify input value
    const value = await page.inputValue('#twotabsearchtextbox');
    expect(value).toBe('laptop');
    
    console.log('✅ Auto-waiting test passed!');
  });
  
});

Run the test:
bash

# Run all tests
