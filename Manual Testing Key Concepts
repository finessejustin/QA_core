Module 1.1
ERROR (Due to Human mistake)
    ↓
DEFECT/BUG (Usually In code)
    ↓
FAILURE (A System crash or wrong output from an Application)

Real World Example:
ERROR: Developer types "if (age > 18)" instead of "if (age >= 18)" while coding an application
DEFECT: Code contains wrong logic
FAILURE: 18-year-old users can't register in the Application(Could result to Revenue losses, etc)

VERIFICATION: "Are we building the product right?"
- Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs
- Checks process compliance
- Example: Code review to check coding standards

VALIDATION: "Are we building the right product?"
- Actual testing against business requirements
- End-user perspective
- Example: Testing to ensure the "login" feature works as Users expect

QA vs QC(Diff)
QA (Process-oriented):
- Proactive
- Preventing defects
- Process improvement
- Example: Creating test standards, code review checklists

QC (Product-oriented):
- Reactive
- Finding defects
- Testing actual product
- Example: Executing test cases, reporting bugs

Module 1.2: Software Development Life Cycle (60 min)
Key SDLC Models
1. Waterfall Model

Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
     ↓           ↓           ↓            ↓          ↓
   (Sequential - each phase completes before next begins)
Usage: Regulated industries e.g Healthcare, Government etc
QA Entry Point: After development completes
Pros: Clear documentation, structured
Cons: Late bug discovery, inflexible to changes

2. Agile/Scrum Model 
Sprint Planning → Development + Testing → Review → Retrospective
        ↓                                    ↑
        └─────────────── (Repeat) ──────────┘
        
Sprints last = 2-4 weeks of work (Total Project SDLC timeline broken down into Sprints)
Real-World Agile Sprint Example:
Day 1-2: Sprint Planning
- User story: "As a user, I want to login with email and password"
- Acceptance criteria defined
- QA reviews requirements, asks questions

Day 3-8: Development + Testing (Parallel)
- Developer codes login feature
- QA writes test cases
- QA tests each completed component
- Daily standup: "I'm testing login API, found 2 bugs"

Day 9: Sprint Review
- Demo to stakeholders
- QA presents test results: 45 test cases, 5 bugs found, 4 fixed

Day 10: Retrospective
- What went well: Early QA involvement caught design issues
- What to improve: Need better test data management

V-Model (Common in regulated industries)
Requirements ←→ Acceptance Testing
     ↓                    ↑
System Design ←→ System Testing
     ↓                    ↑
Detailed Design ←→ Integration Testing
     ↓                    ↑
Coding ←→ Unit Testing

Module 1.3: Testing Levels (45 min)
1. Unit Testing (Developer responsibility, but QA should understand)
# What it looks like
def calculate_total(price, quantity, discount):
    """Calculate order total with discount"""
    subtotal = price * quantity
    return subtotal - (subtotal * discount / 100)

# Unit test
def test_calculate_total():
    assert calculate_total(100, 2, 10) == 180  # 200 - 10% = 180
    assert calculate_total(50, 1, 0) == 50      # No discount
    assert calculate_total(100, 0, 10) == 0     # Zero quantity
```

**What QA tests here:** 
- Review unit test coverage reports
- Suggest edge cases developers might miss
- Verify critical business logic has unit tests

---

#### **2. Integration Testing** (QA heavily involved)

**Real Example: E-commerce Checkout**
```
Component A: Shopping Cart
Component B: Payment Gateway  
Component C: Inventory System
Component D: Email Service

Integration Test Scenarios:
1. Cart sends order to Payment Gateway
   - Test: Does total amount match?
   - Test: Are all items included?

2. Payment Gateway confirms payment
   - Test: Does Inventory get reduced?
   - Test: Does confirmation email send?

3. Failed payment scenario
   - Test: Is cart preserved?
   - Test: Is inventory NOT reduced?
   - Test: Does error email send?
```

**Common Integration Bugs:**
- Data format mismatch (Cart sends "$100.00", API expects 10000 cents)
- Timing issues (Email sends before payment confirms)
- Missing error handling (API timeout not handled)

---

#### **3. System Testing** (QA primary responsibility)

**Testing entire application end-to-end**

**Example: Online Banking System Test**
```
Test Scenario: Fund Transfer

Preconditions:
- User A has account with $1000
- User B has account with $500

Test Steps:
1. Login as User A
2. Navigate to Transfer Money
3. Enter User B's account number
4. Enter amount: $200
5. Enter password for confirmation
6. Submit transfer

Expected Results:
✓ Transfer confirmation message appears
✓ User A balance: $800
✓ User B balance: $700
✓ Transaction appears in both histories
✓ Email sent to both users
✓ Transaction ID generated

Verify also:
✗ Can't transfer more than available balance
✗ Can't transfer to invalid account
✗ Can't transfer negative amounts
✗ Session timeout works during transfer
```

---

#### **4. Acceptance Testing** (Business validation)

**Types:**

**User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
```
Real users test in production-like environment

Example: New search feature
- Marketing team tests: "Can I search by brand?"
- Sales team tests: "Can I filter by price range?"
- Customer support tests: "Are results relevant?"

Pass criteria: 90% of users say "Yes, this works for my needs"
```

**Alpha Testing:**
- Internal company users test
- Office environment
- Developers present to fix bugs immediately

**Beta Testing:**
```
Example: Mobile App Beta Program

Phase 1: Closed Beta (100 users)
- Controlled group
- Active feedback collection
- Week 1-2

Phase 2: Open Beta (10,000 users)
- Public can join
- Gather crash reports, feedback
- Week 3-6

Metrics tracked:
- Crash rate
- User retention
- Feature usage
- Bug reports
```

### **Module 1.5: Bug Severity vs Priority (30 min)**

**Critical Matrix:**
```
                HIGH PRIORITY          LOW PRIORITY
              ┌──────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
CRITICAL      │ P0: Drop everything  │ P2: Important   │
SEVERITY      │ (App crashes)        │ (Typo on        │
              │                      │  homepage)       │
              ├──────────────────────┼─────────────────┤
LOW           │ P1: Fix soon         │ P3: Nice to have│

```

---

### **Module 1.6: Types of Testing (45 min)**

#### **Functional Testing**
Testing what the system does

**Categories:**

**1. Smoke Testing** (Build Verification)
```
Quick test to verify basic functionality works

Example: E-commerce smoke test (15 minutes)
✓ Homepage loads
✓ Can login
✓ Can search products
✓ Can add to cart
✓ Can initiate checkout

Purpose: Decide if build is stable enough for detailed testing
When: After each new build/deployment
```

**2. Sanity Testing** (Focused verification)
```
Narrow, deep testing of specific functionality

Example: After fixing "login with email" bug
✓ Login with valid email ✓
✓ Login with invalid email ✓
✓ Login with email (uppercase) ✓
✓ Login with email (spaces) ✓
✓ SQL injection in email field ✓
✗ Don't test cart, checkout (unrelated)

Purpose: Verify specific fix works
When: After bug fix, before full regression
```

**3. Regression Testing**
```
Ensure new changes didn't break existing functionality

Example: After adding "Guest Checkout" feature

Full Regression Suite (200 test cases):
- Login/Logout (20 cases)
- Product Search (30 cases)
- Shopping Cart (40 cases)
- Checkout - Registered User (50 cases)
- Checkout - Guest User (30 cases) ← NEW
- Payment Processing (30 cases)

Focus areas:
✓ All existing checkout flows still work
✓ Guest checkout doesn't break registered flow
✓ Cart persistence works for both user types
```

**4. Exploratory Testing**
```
Unscripted testing, learning while testing

Session Charter: "Explore image upload feature for 60 minutes"

What I'll look for:
- File type handling
- File size limits
- Multiple uploads
- Upload cancellation
- Progress indicators
- Error messages

Notes during exploration:
[00:10] Uploaded PNG - works ✓
[00:15] Uploaded 50MB file - no size warning ⚠️
[00:22] Uploaded .exe file - accepted! BUG 🐛
[00:35] Rapid multiple uploads - race condition, one file lost BUG 🐛
[00:45] Progress bar stuck at 99% for large files BUG 🐛

Result: 3 bugs found, filed as SHOP-1240, SHOP-1241, SHOP-1242
```

---

#### **Non-Functional Testing**

**1. Performance Testing**
```
Response time, throughput, resource usage

Example: API Performance Requirements
- Average response time: < 200ms
- 95th percentile: < 500ms
- 99th percentile: < 1000ms
- Throughput: 1000 requests/second

Test: Load 1000 concurrent users for 10 minutes
Results:
Average: 180ms ✓
95th: 450ms ✓
99th: 1200ms ✗ FAILS requirement
Throughput: 950 req/sec ✗ FAILS requirement

Bottleneck found: Database query not indexed
```

**2. Load Testing**
```
System behavior under expected load

Example: E-commerce site during normal traffic
- Expected users: 1000 concurrent
- Test duration: 1 hour
- User actions: Browse (60%), Add to cart (30%), Checkout (10%)

Results:
✓ All pages load < 3 seconds
✓ No errors under normal load
✓ Database CPU: 60% (healthy)
✓ Application servers: 40% (healthy)
```

**3. Stress Testing**
```
Find breaking point

Example: Push system beyond limits
Start: 1000 users
Increase by 500 every 5 minutes

Results:
1000 users: All good ✓
1500 users: Some slow responses (3-4 sec)
2000 users: Occasional errors (5%)
2500 users: Many errors (20%), some timeouts
3000 users: System unresponsive, database locks

Breaking point: 2500 users
Recommendation: Scale infrastructure before reaching 2000 concurrent
```

**4. Usability Testing**
```
Is it user-friendly?

Example: New mobile app navigation

Test: Give 10 users tasks, observe
Task 1: "Find your order history"
- 8/10 users found it < 30 seconds ✓
- 2/10 users confused, took 2 minutes ✗

Task 2: "Change delivery address"
- 3/10 users found it < 1 minute ✗
- 7/10 users gave up, asked for help ✗✗

Finding: "Change delivery address" needs better visibility
Solution: Add to main menu instead of nested in settings
```

**5. Compatibility Testing**
```
Works across environments

Browser Matrix:
Chrome ✓, Firefox ✓, Safari ✓, Edge ✓
IE 11 ✗ (layout broken)

Mobile:
iOS 16 ✓, iOS 15 ✓, Android 13 ✓, Android 11 ✗ (crashes)

Screen resolutions:
1920x1080 ✓, 1366x768 ✓, 375x667 (iPhone) ✓
320x568 (small phone) ✗ (buttons overlap)
```

**6. Security Testing**
```
Protect against attacks

Tests:
✓ SQL Injection: Tried ' OR '1'='1, properly escaped
✓ XSS: Tried <script>alert('XSS')</script>, sanitized
✗ CSRF: No token on state-changing operations BUG
✗ Password policy: Accepts "123456" BUG
✓ Session timeout: Works after 30 min inactivity
✗ API: No rate limiting, vulnerable to DDoS BUG

Improvement: Add validation message "Special characters not allowed"
```

---

### **Test Scenario 2: Filter Functionality (45 min)**

**TC-010: Multiple Filters**
```
Scenario: Apply multiple filters and verify results

Steps:
1. Search for "London"
2. Apply filters:
   - Price: £50-£100
   - Star rating: 4+ stars
   - Free cancellation: Yes
   - Distance from center: < 1 km
3. Scroll through results

Verification:
✓ Do ALL results match filter criteria?
✓ Check first 10 results:
   Result 1: £___, ⭐___, Cancellation: ___, Distance: ___
   Result 2: ...
   
⚠️ Look for violations
```

**TC-011: Filter Edge Cases**
```
Test these:
1. Set price filter min = max (£50-£50)
2. Select ALL meal plan options
3. Select conflicting filters (if any)
4. Remove filters one by one (do results update?)
5. Clear all filters quickly

EXPECTED BUG TO FIND:
- Filters might not apply correctly
- Results might not update
- Price filter might show properties outside range
```

**TC-012: Filter Persistence**
```
Test flow:
1. Apply filters: 4⭐, Free WiFi, Pool
2. Click on a property
3. Click browser back button
4. Check filters

Expected: Filters still applied
Actual: ?

Then:
5. Refresh page (F5)
6. Check filters

Expected: Filters persist (or are in URL)
Actual: ?
```

---

**🔍 REAL BUG YOU'LL FIND:**
```
Title: Price filter shows properties outside selected range

Severity: Major
Priority: High
Component: Search/Filters

Steps:
1. Search "Paris"
2. Set price filter: $100-$150
3. Scroll through results
4. Click "Show all prices" button on property cards

Expected: All properties shown should be $100-$150 for selected dates
Actual: Found property showing $189 per night

Root cause: Filter shows "starting from" price, but different dates have different prices

Screenshot: [Attach showing $189 property in $100-$150 filtered results]

Recommendation: Filter should be based on user's selected dates, not lowest available price
```

---

### **Test Scenario 3: Property Details Page (45 min)**

**TC-020: Image Gallery**
```
Test:
1. Open any property
2. Click main image to open gallery
3. Navigate through images:
   - Click next arrow 20 times
   - Click previous arrow
   - Click on thumbnail
   - Use keyboard arrows
   - Swipe on mobile (DevTools)

- Any console errors?
```

**TC-021: Room Selection**
```
Scenario: Select different room options

1. Pick property with multiple room types
2. For each room type, check:
   ✓ Price displays correctly
   ✓ Amenities listed
   ✓ Max occupancy shown
   ✓ Photos available
3. Try selecting:
   - 1 room
   - 2 rooms of same type
   - Multiple room types

2. Apply review filters:
   - Solo traveler
   - Families
   - Rating: 9+
3. Sort by:
   - Most recent
   - Highest score
   - Lowest score

Verify:
✓ Do filtered reviews match criteria?
✓ Does sorting work correctly?
✓ Read 5 reviews, check if rating matches content

EXPECTED BUG:
- Review filter might not work properly
- Dates might be incorrect
- Translation issues
```

---

**🔍 REAL BUG YOU'LL FIND:**
```
Title: Image gallery counter shows wrong total after filtering

Steps:
1. Open property with 50+ photos
2. Open gallery
3. Filter by "Room" photos only (now shows 12 photos)
4. Navigate to last image
5. Observe counter

Expected: Shows "12 of 12"
Actual: Shows "12 of 50"

Severity: Minor
Priority: Low

Additional: When clicking "Next" on image 12, it shows image 13 (from unfiltered set)
This is confusing UX - counter suggests 12 photos but you can access more
```

---

### **Test Scenario 4: Booking Flow (60 min)**

**TC-030: Guest Checkout**
```
Full booking simulation (DON'T actually book):

1. Select property and room
2. Click "Reserve"
3. Enter guest details:
   - First name
   - Last name  
   - Email
   - Phone
4. Enter payment details (use test credit card numbers)
5. Stop before final confirmation

Test variations:
- Leave fields empty (one at a time)
- Enter invalid emails:
  * "invalidemail"
  * "test@"
  * "test@domain"
  * "@domain.com"
  * <script>alert('xss')</script>@test.com
- Enter invalid phone:
  * Letters: "abcd1234"
  * Special chars: "+++++++"
  * Too short: "123"
- Enter invalid names:
  * Numbers: "12345"
  * Very long: 500 characters
  * SQL injection: "Robert'); DROP TABLE users;--"
```

**TC-031: Payment Validation**
```
Test credit card field with:

Valid formats (test cards - DON'T use real):
✓ 4111 1111 1111 1111 (Visa test)
✓ 5500 0000 0000 0004 (Mastercard test)

Invalid formats:
✗ 1234 5678 9012 3456
✗ 4111-1111-1111-1111 (with dashes)
✗ 4111111111111111 (no spaces)
✗ Letters: aaaa bbbb cccc dddd
✗ Script: <script>alert('xss')</script>

Verify:
- Does validation work?
- What error messages appear?
- Can you bypass client-side validation using DevTools?
```

**TC-032: Total Price Verification**
```
Critical test - verify price calculation:

1. Note room price: $___
2. Number of nights: ___
3. Number of rooms: ___
4. Note taxes/fees: $___
5. Check total: $___

Manual calculation:
(Room price × Nights × Rooms) + Taxes = Expected total

Does it match shown total? Yes/No

Test edge cases:
- Long stays (30 nights) - does price change?
- Multiple rooms (5+ rooms) - discounts applied?
- Different dates - weekday vs weekend pricing
```

---

**🔍 REAL CRITICAL BUG YOU'LL FIND:**
```
Title: Can modify booking total by manipulating request payload

Severity: CRITICAL
Priority: URGENT
Component: Payment Processing

Steps:
1. Add room to cart: $200/night × 2 nights = $400
2. Proceed to payment page
3. Open DevTools → Network tab
4. Fill payment form but don't submit
5. Right-click on payment request → Edit and Resend
6. Change JSON payload: "totalAmount": 400 → "totalAmount": 1
7. Send modified request

Expected: Server validates and rejects modified amount
Actual: [NEED TO TEST - might accept modified amount]

Security Impact: HIGH
- Financial loss for business
- Users could book rooms for $1

Recommendation:
- Server MUST recalculate total from:
  * Property ID
  * Room ID  
  * Check-in/check-out dates
  * Number of rooms
- Never trust client-provided total
```

---

### **Test Scenario 5: Mobile Responsiveness (45 min)**

**Setup:**

---

**Test Case Best Practices:**

✅ **DO:**
- Write clear, unambiguous steps
- Use active voice ("Click login button")
- Include all necessary test data
- Specify expected results precisely
- Make test cases independent (not dependent on other tests)
- Include setup (preconditions) and cleanup steps

❌ **DON'T:**
- Be vague ("Test login feature")
- Assume knowledge ("Login normally")
- Combine multiple scenarios in one test case
- Skip expected results
- Make tests dependent on execution order

---

**Good vs Bad Test Case Examples:**

**❌ Bad Test Case:**

Test Case: Login test
Steps: Login with correct credentials
Expected: Should work


**✅ Good Test Case:**

Test Case ID: TC-LOGIN-001
Title: Successful login with valid email and password

Preconditions:

    Database contains user: email=test@example.com, password=Pass123!
    User is logged out
    Browser cookies cleared

Test Data: Email: test@example.com Password: Pass123!

Steps:

    Open URL: https://app.example.com/login
    Locate "Email" input field (ID: email-input)
    Enter test data email: test@example.com
    Locate "Password" input field (ID: password-input)
    Enter test data password: Pass123!
    Locate "Login" button (ID: login-btn)
    Click "Login" button

Expected Results:
Step 7:

    HTTP 200 response received
    Redirected to /dashboard within 2 seconds
    URL becomes: https://app.example.com/dashboard
    Page displays "Welcome back, Test User"
    Navigation bar shows "Logout" button
    Session token stored in browser (cookies or localStorage)
    Profile icon displays user initials "TU"

Actual Results: [Fill during execution]

Pass/Fail: [Fill during execution]

Priority: P0 (Critical path)
Test Type: Functional, Positive Testing
Environment: Staging
Browser: Chrome 120, Firefox 121
OS: Windows 11, macOS 13

### **Module 2.2: Equivalence Partitioning (45 min)**

**Concept:**
Divide input data into groups (partitions) where the system should behave the same way. Test one value from each partition instead of testing every possible value.

**Example: Age Input Field (18-65 allowed)**

**Partitions:**

Invalid partition 1: Age < 18    (Examples: 0, 5, 17)
Valid partition:     Age 18-65   (Examples: 18, 35, 65)
Invalid partition 2: Age > 65    (Examples: 66, 100, 120)


**Test Cases (only 3 needed instead of testing every age):**

TC-AGE-001: Test with age = 17 (Invalid partition 1)
Expected: Error message "Must be 18 or older"

TC-AGE-002: Test with age = 35 (Valid partition)
Expected: Input accepted, proceed to next step

TC-AGE-003: Test with age = 66 (Invalid partition 2)
Expected: Error message "Maximum age is 65"


---

**Real Example: E-commerce Discount Code**

**Requirement:**

Discount codes:

    SAVE10: 10% off orders $50-$100
    SAVE20: 20% off orders $100-$500
    SAVE30: 30% off orders $500+
    WINTER: $15 flat discount, any order


**Equivalence Partitions:**

Code validity:

    Valid codes: SAVE10, SAVE20, SAVE30, WINTER
    Invalid codes: INVALID, EXPIRED123, empty, special chars

Order amount for SAVE10:

    Below minimum: $0-$49.99
    Valid range: $50-$100
    Above range: $100.01+

Order amount for SAVE20:

    Below minimum: $0-$99.99
    Valid range: $100-$500
    Above range: $500.01+


**Test Cases:**

TC-DISC-001: Valid code "SAVE10" with order $75 (valid range)
Expected: 10% discount applied, total = $67.50

TC-DISC-002: Valid code "SAVE10" with order $45 (below minimum)
Expected: Error "Code SAVE10 requires minimum $50 order"

TC-DISC-003: Valid code "SAVE10" with order $150 (above range)
Expected: Error "Code SAVE10 valid for orders up to $100"

TC-DISC-004: Invalid code "EXPIRED" with order $75
Expected: Error "Invalid discount code"

TC-DISC-005: Empty code field with order $75
Expected: Error "Please enter discount code" OR proceeds without discount

TC-DISC-006: Code "WINTER" with order $25
Expected: $15 discount applied, total = $10

TC-DISC-007: Code "WINTER" with order $10
Expected: $15 discount applied, total = $0 OR error "Cannot exceed order total"


---

**Exercise: Apply Equivalence Partitioning**

**Scenario: Password Field Requirements**

Password must:

    Be 8-20 characters long
    Contain at least 1 uppercase letter
    Contain at least 1 lowercase letter
    Contain at least 1 number
    Contain at least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*)


**Your turn - identify partitions:**

Length partitions:

    Too short: ___
    Valid: ___
    Too long: ___

Character type partitions:

    Missing uppercase: ___
    Missing lowercase: ___
    Missing number: ___
    Missing special char: ___
    Has all required types: ___


**Solution:**

TC-PASS-001: Length too short (5 chars) "Ab1!"
Expected: Error "Password must be at least 8 characters"

TC-PASS-002: Length valid (12 chars), all requirements "Password123!"
Expected: Password accepted

TC-PASS-003: Length too long (25 chars) "Password123!ExtraCharacters"
Expected: Error "Password must be maximum 20 characters"

TC-PASS-004: Valid length, missing uppercase "password123!"
Expected: Error "Password must contain uppercase letter"

TC-PASS-005: Valid length, missing lowercase "PASSWORD123!"
Expected: Error "Password must contain lowercase letter"

TC-PASS-006: Valid length, missing number "Password!!!"
Expected: Error "Password must contain number"

TC-PASS-007: Valid length, missing special char "Password123"
Expected: Error "Password must contain special character"

TC-PASS-008: Valid length, all requirements "MyPass123!"
Expected: Password accepted


---

### **Module 2.3: Boundary Value Analysis (45 min)**

**Concept:**
Bugs often occur at boundaries. Test at the edge of equivalence partitions.

**Boundary Testing Rules:**

For range A to B, test:

    Just below A (A-1)
    Exactly A
    Just above A (A+1)
    Middle value
    Just below B (B-1)
    Exactly B
    Just above B (B+1)


**Example: Quantity Field (1-10 items allowed)**

**Boundaries:**

Lower boundary = 1
Upper boundary = 10

Test values:
0  (lower boundary - 1) ❌
1  (lower boundary)     ✓
2  (lower boundary + 1) ✓
5  (middle value)       ✓
9  (upper boundary - 1) ✓
10 (upper boundary)     ✓
11 (upper boundary + 1) ❌


**Test Cases:**

TC-QTY-001: Quantity = 0
Input: 0
Expected: Error "Minimum quantity is 1" OR field doesn't accept 0

TC-QTY-002: Quantity = 1
Input: 1
Expected: Accepted, can add to cart

TC-QTY-003: Quantity = 2
Input: 2
Expected: Accepted, can add to cart

TC-QTY-004: Quantity = 10
Input: 10
Expected: Accepted, can add to cart

TC-QTY-005: Quantity = 11
Input: 11
Expected: Error "Maximum quantity is 10" OR field doesn't accept 11

TC-QTY-006: Quantity = -1
Input: -1
Expected: Error "Quantity must be positive" OR field doesn't accept negative

TC-QTY-007: Quantity = 999
Input: 999
Expected: Error "Maximum quantity is 10"

**Real Example: Flight Booking - Passenger Age**

**Business Rules:**

Infant: 0-2 years (lap child, no seat)
Child: 2-12 years (discounted fare)
Adult: 12-64 years (standard fare)
Senior: 65+ years (discounted fare)


**Boundary Values to Test:**

Boundaries: 0, 2, 12, 65

Test cases:
TC-AGE-001: Age = -1 (invalid)
Expected: Error "Invalid age"

TC-AGE-002: Age = 0 (infant lower boundary)
Expected: Classified as Infant, no seat assigned

TC-AGE-003: Age = 1 (infant middle)
Expected: Classified as Infant

TC-AGE-004: Age = 2 (boundary: infant/child)
Expected: Class ified as Child (or Infant - clarify requirement!)
🚨 This is a critical test! Business must decide: is 2 infant or child?

TC-AGE-005: Age = 3 (child confirmed)
Expected: Classified as Child, child fare applied

TC-AGE-006: Age = 11 (child upper boundary - 1)
Expected: Classified as Child

TC-AGE-007: Age = 12 (boundary: child/adult)
Expected: Classified as Adult (or Child - clarify!)
🚨 Critical boundary!

TC-AGE-008: Age = 13 (adult confirmed)
Expected: Classified as Adult, standard fare

TC-AGE-009: Age = 64 (adult upper boundary)
Expected: Classified as Adult

TC-AGE-010: Age = 65 (boundary: adult/senior)
Expected: Classified as Senior, senior discount applied

TC-AGE-011: Age = 66 (senior confirmed)
Expected: Classified as Senior

TC-AGE-012: Age = 120 (extreme value)
Expected: Either accepted or error "Please verify age"


**Key Learning:**
Boundary testing often reveals ambiguous requirements! Age 2 and 12 need clarification from business.

### **Module 2.4: Decision Table Testing (60 min)**

**Concept:**
For testing complex business rules with multiple conditions and different actions based on combinations of conditions.

**When to Use:**
- Multiple input conditions
- Different combinations produce different outcomes
- Complex business logic

**Example: Loan Approval System**

**Business Rules:**

Loan approved IF:

    Credit score >= 700 AND
    Income >= $50,000 AND
    Debt-to-income ratio < 40%

Special cases:

    Existing customer with good history: Credit score >= 650
    High income (>$150k): Debt ratio can be up to 45%


**Decision Table:**

Conditions               | Rule1 | Rule2 | Rule3 | Rule4 | Rule5 | Rule6
------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------
Credit Score >= 700     |   Y   |   Y   |   Y   |   N   |   Y   |   N
Income >= $50,000       |   Y   |   Y   |   N   |   Y   |   N   |   N
Debt Ratio < 40%        |   Y   |   N   |   Y   |   Y   |   Y   |   Y
------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------
Actions                 |       |       |       |       |       |
------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------
Approve Loan            |   X   |       |       |       |       |
Reject - High Debt      |       |   X   |       |       |       |
Reject - Low Income     |       |       |   X   |       |   X   |
Reject - Poor Credit    |       |       |       |   X   |       |   X
Reject - Multiple       |       |       |       |       |       |

### **Module 2.5: State Transition Testing (45 min)**

**Concept:**
Test how a system behaves when transitioning between different states based on events/inputs.

**When to Use:**
- System has distinct states
- Behavior changes based on current state
- Events trigger state changes

**Example: Order Status Workflow**

**States:**

    Pending Payment
    Payment Confirmed
    Processing
    Shipped
    Delivered
    Cancelled
    Refunded


**State Transition Diagram:**

┌─────────────┐
│   Pending   │
│   Payment   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Payment Received
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Payment   │──────→ Cancel ──→ Refunded
│  Confirmed  │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Start Processing
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│ Processing  │──────→ Cancel ──→ Refunded
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Dispatch
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Shipped   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Delivery Confirmed
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  Delivered  │──────→ Return ──→ Refunded
└─────────────┘


**State Transition Table:**

Current State    | Event              | Next State        | Actions
-----------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------
Pending Payment  | Payment Received   | Payment Confirmed | Send confirmation email
Pending Payment  | Cancel Order       | Cancelled         | Release reserved items
Payment Confirmed| Start Processing   | Processing        | Notify warehouse
Payment Confirmed| Cancel Order       | Refunded          | Process refund
Processing       | Dispatch Order     | Shipped           | Send tracking number
Processing       | Cancel Order       | Refunded          | Stop processing, refund
Shipped          | Delivery Confirmed | Delivered         | Request review
Delivered        | Return Request     | Refunded          | Create return label


**Test Cases - Valid Transitions:**

TC-STATE-001: Pending → Payment Confirmed
Precondition: Order in "Pending Payment" state
Action: Submit payment (credit card approved)
Expected:

    State changes to "Payment Confirmed"
    Confirmation email sent
    Payment receipt generated
    Order summary page shows "Payment Confirmed"

TC-STATE-002: Payment Confirmed → Processing
Precondition: Order in "Payment Confirmed" state
Action: Warehouse starts processing order
Expected:

    State changes to "Processing"
    Customer receives "We're preparing your order" email
    Items reserved in inventory
    Estimated processing time displayed

TC-STATE-003: Processing → Shipped
Precondition: Order in "Processing" state
Action: Order dispatched by warehouse
Expected:

    State changes to "Shipped"
    Tracking number generated and sent to customer
    Estimated delivery date shown
    Inventory updated

TC-STATE-004: Shipped → Delivered
Precondition: Order in "Shipped" state
Action: Delivery confirmed by courier
Expected:

    State changes to "Delivered"
    Customer receives delivery confirmation
    Review request sent after 3 days
    Return window starts (30 days)


**Test Cases - Invalid Transitions (Negative Testing):**

TC-STATE-NEG-001: Try to ship order still in "Pending Payment"
Precondition: Order in "Pending Payment" state
Action: Attempt to mark as "Shipped"
Expected:

    Error: "Cannot ship order without payment confirmation"
    State remains "Pending Payment"
    No shipping notification sent

TC-STATE-NEG-002: Try to cancel order already "Delivered"
Precondition: Order in "Delivered" state
Action: Attempt to cancel order
Expected:

    Error: "Cannot cancel delivered order. Please request return instead"
    State remains "Delivered"
    Shows "Request Return" button instead

TC-STATE-NEG-003: Try to confirm delivery for order in "Processing"
Precondition: Order in "Processing" state
Action: Attempt to mark as "Delivered"
Expected:

    Error: "Order must be shipped before delivery confirmation"
    State remains "Processing"
    Invalid state transition logged

TC-STATE-NEG-004: Try to process refund for "Pending Payment" order
Precondition: Order in "Pending Payment" state
Action: Attempt to issue refund
Expected:

    Error: "No payment received. Order will be cancelled instead."
    State changes to "Cancelled" (not Refunded)
    No refund processed


**Test Cases - Edge Cases:**

TC-STATE-EDGE-001: Multiple rapid state changes
Precondition: Order in "Payment Confirmed"
Actions (rapid succession):

    Click "Cancel Order"
    Immediately, warehouse starts processing Expected:

    System should handle race condition
    Either: Cancellation succeeds (prevents processing)
    Or: Processing succeeds (prevents cancellation)
    One action must be rejected with clear error
    No orphaned state

TC-STATE-EDGE-002: Payment confirmation timeout
Precondition: Order in "Pending Payment" for 24 hours
Action: Time passes, no payment received
Expected:

    Auto-transition to "Cancelled" after 24 hours
    Inventory released
    Customer notified: "Your order was cancelled due to payment timeout"

TC-STATE-EDGE-003: Lost shipment scenario
Precondition: Order "Shipped" for 30 days, no delivery
Action: Customer reports non-delivery
Expected:

    System allows re-shipment or refund
    Investigation workflow triggered
    State: "Shipped - Under Investigation"
    Customer service can manually transition to "Refunded"

**Real Example: User Account States**

**States:**

    Not Registered
    Registered (email unverified)
    Active
    Suspended
    Locked (too many login attempts)
    Deactivated (user requested)
    Deleted


**State Transitions:**

Not Registered → Registered: User completes signup form
Registered → Active: User clicks verification link in email
Registered → Deleted: Verification not completed in 7 days

Active → Suspended: Admin action (violation of terms)
Active → Locked: 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes
Active → Deactivated: User chooses to deactivate account

Locked → Active: Wait 30 minutes OR password reset
Suspended → Active: Admin reinstates account
Deactivated → Active: User reactivates within 30 days
Deactivated → Deleted: 30 days pass without reactivation


**Test Cases:**

TC-USER-001: Registration to Active (Happy Path)

    User registers with email test@example.com Expected: State = "Registered", verification email sent
    User clicks verification link Expected: State = "Active", can login

TC-USER-002: Account locking mechanism

    User account in "Active" state
    Attempt login with wrong password (5 times) Attempt 1: Error "Incorrect password" Attempt 2: Error "Incorrect password" Attempt 3: Error "Incorrect password" Attempt 4: Error "Incorrect password, 1 attempt remaining" Attempt 5: Error "Account locked for 30 minutes"
    Expected: State = "Locked"
    Attempt login with correct password Expected: Error "Account locked. Try again in 30 minutes"
    Wait 30 minutes
    Login with correct password Expected: State = "Active", successful login

TC-USER-003: Invalid state transition

    User account in "Suspended" state
    User attempts to login Expected: Error "Account suspended. Contact support."
    User attempts password reset Expected: Error "Account suspended. Cannot reset password."
    State remains "Suspended"

TC-USER-004: Deactivation and reactivation window

    User in "Active" state
    User clicks "Deactivate Account" Expected: State = "Deactivated", confirmation email sent
    User attempts login after 15 days Expected: Prompt to reactivate account
    User clicks "Reactivate" Expected: State = "Active", welcome back email
    New scenario: User deactivates, waits 31 days Expected: State = "Deleted", cannot reactivate, must register again
